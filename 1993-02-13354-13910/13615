Summary: RIPEM 1.0.4 & Mac RIPEM 0.7b1
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL8]
Xref: msuinfo alt.security.ripem:130 sci.crypt:13615

RIPEM 1.0.4 is now available.  The most notable change from
1.0.3 is a change in MIC-CLEAR mode.   The processing of lines 
starting with "-" has been changed to conform with Internet
RFC's.  This means that RIPEM 1.0.4 is incompatible with 
previous versions for certain messages in MIC-CLEAR mode.

Raymond Lau has released the latest version of his Macintosh
implementation of RIPEM.  This new version, 0.7b1, also incorporates
the MIC-CLEAR mode change.  Raymond's Macintosh version has been
received enthusiastically by testers.

(RIPEM is a public key encryption program that provides a subset
of the features of Internet Privacy-Enhanced Mail.  RIPEM is free
for non-commercial users.  To find out how to get RIPEM, FTP to
ripem.msu.edu and look for the document GETTING_ACCESS.)


Changes between 1.0.3 and 1.0.4:

+++ Modified RIPEM's MIC-CLEAR mode to quote leading "-"'s correctly.
(Changes to ripemmai.c and rdwrmsg.c.)  (Raymond Lau)

+++ Provided a new, faster MC68020 version of nn.c for the Macintosh,
Think C.  (See mac68K directory.)  (Richard Outerbridge)

+++ Provided a new, faster MC68020 version of RSAREF's r_stdlib
for the Macintosh, Think C (see mac68K directory).  (Richard Outerbridge)

+++ Added makefile entry to RSAREF for Linux.  (Mark C. Henderson)

+++ Added moderate RSAREF speedup for IBM RS/6000 (files nn.c and
digit.c).  (Mark C. Henderson)

+++ Enhanced the UDP-based key server, rkeyserv, to fork and detach 
itself automatically.  (David C Lawrence)

+++ Enhanced the update-key-database script (used only by key servers).
(David C Lawrence)

+++ Updated ripem-attacks and ripem-faq.  (Marc VanHeyningen)

+++ Modified display-ripem (v. 1.0) and send-ripem (v. 1.0) utilities,
and provided encrypt-ripem (v. 1.0).  These are Perl scripts that
work with RIPEM.  (Marc VanHeyningen)

+++ Added utility encrypt-ripem, superior version of the
shell script ripem-encrypt, but this one's in Perl.  (Marc VanHeyningen)

+++ Fixed the ripem-encrypt utility to not overwrite the input 
if RIPEM fails (due to mistyped password, etc.)  (Michael Palmer)

+++ Fixed a bug in ripem.el (EMACS code) in ripem-list-users.
(Jeff Thompson)

+++ Made several improvements to the utility quote.  (V. Bontchev)

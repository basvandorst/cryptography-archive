Here is a new request for materials for the Flame Fest.  An earlier poster
(Ted Dunning) noted that it would be useful to be able to compile the
source code and fiddle with it.  He is absolutely right.  He also was
concientious enough to want to abide by the request form, so here's a new
one that lets any participants do both.  Also, I hadn't intended for the
form to "limit" personal use of the source code, so I've changed that, too.

Thanks to those who have shown interest!

	   Request For Materials and License Agreement For
		     the Rcrypt Challenge: Part I


I, ____________________________________________________________ (name)

of _______________________________________________ (company, optional)
request materials for the Rcrypt Challenge: Part I.  The HOSTID of the

Sun SPARCstation I intend to run Rcrypt on is _______________________
(The hostid is required in order to recieve the executable.  If the
hostid is omitted, all other materials will be sent.)  In order to
recieve these materials, I agree to the following terms:

	   1) I will not decompile, reduce to human readable form,
	      copy, or redistribute the Rcrypt executable.

           2) I will not redistribute the source code.  Any executable
              derived from the source code will only be used for personal
              purposes, instructional purposes, research, or this
              challenge.  I will not distribute such executable.

	   3) I will not attempt to produce a working license for the
              Rcrypt executable that has a different expiration date
              or a different hostid than the one provided as a part
              of the requested materials.

The only exceptions to these terms are copies of the executable and
license(s) made for backup purposes, and copies of the executable,
source code, and license(s) made for the Sun SPARCstations identified
by the following hostids:

	_________________________	_________________________

	_________________________	_________________________

	_________________________	_________________________

	_________________________	_________________________

	_________________________	_________________________


(The license file we provide will include licenses for all of the
listed hostids.  Simply copy this file into into the appropriate
directory for each Sun.  Upon execution, Rcrypt will search the
license file for the appropriate entry.)

Note that all materials besides the executable, source codes, and
license(s) are not restricted by this license agreement.

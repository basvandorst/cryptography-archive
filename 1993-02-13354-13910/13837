The fact that the NSA has (quietly, in its back-door agreement with
SPA) agreed to allow export of software packages using RC2 and RC4
with keys of 40 bits or less argues pretty persuasively that these
algorithms are not secure, at least with these key lengths (of course
it would be hard to build any secure cipher with such a short key).

RSADSI has also made a curious statement that they will not release
descriptions of RC2 and RC4 "to preserve their special export status".

You know, there will be a minor drawback to removing all export
controls on crypto software. Right now, if the NSA approves an
algorithm for export, you know for SURE that it's completely
worthless. Once the controls are lifted, we'll be completely on our
own...

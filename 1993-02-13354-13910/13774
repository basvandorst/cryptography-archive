Of course he had - he could save a copy of the armored message,
convert it to plain text (thus losing my signature), then post a
message that contained BOTH the cleantext and the armored text and
saying: "Here's Bontchev's confirmation in plain text and here it is,
signed by him, in an armored text, so that everybody could verify his
signature".

Yes, your idea seems good to me. PGP already can "detach a signature";
that is, remove the signature from a message and put it in a separate
file. There should also a possibility to convert armored text to
clearsigned text, or to detach the singature from a cleansigned text,
etc.

Also a good idea, with a small remark - the user should be able to
tell PGP to always reject keys for which there are "third party
revokation certificates" or to always accept them - not just to ask
the user each time. This will make the life easier for the developers
of key server software...

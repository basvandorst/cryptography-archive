Folks were asking about the status of sci.crypt.research.  I think
this clarifies things somewhat...

  I don't recall what length of discussion period was proposed in the
RFD.  Under the USENET guidelines, a proposal must have at least 3
weeks of discussion period before a vote.  There has been discussion
and my belief is that consensus was reached on 1) leaving sci.crypt as
is and 2) creating sci.crypt.research (moderated).  Several reasonable
folks volunteered to moderate (and I have no problems with any of
them).

  The original proposer of the RFD might check and see if it is legal
to post a Call For Votes (including stating who the moderator(s) are
to be).  Since I didn't post the RFD, it isn't up to me to post the
CFV.

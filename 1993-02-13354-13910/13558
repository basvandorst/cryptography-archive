   Although I never tried it to see if the path actually worked,
   I did write down one reputed ftp site:

      black.ox.ac.uk  (127.67.1.165)  /src/vcr+.shar.Z

   Supposedly this is the C version, but as I haven't personally
   verified it, you should treat the information as "a rumour"
   not as "a fact".

I can confirm its reality.  I put the file there.  Not only is it
a C version, it is the US algorithm to boot.  The UK Videoplus
system uses a similar but incompatible encryption method.  We're
working on it ...

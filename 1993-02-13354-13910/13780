Hello!

The materials for the Rcrypt Challenge are now available for anonymous FTP
from 'cranel.com' (157.134.1.1) in the /pub directory.  The files you can
get there are:

	rcrypt-challenge.tar.Z: compressed tar file of the materials
	rcrypt-c.zip:           (PK)ZIPped file of the materials (for PC's)
	RCRYPT-CHALLENGE:	A directory containing the materials in
				uncompressed/unzipped form.

Please note that the executable and source code aren't available via FTP (I
don't want to go to jail :)  The RFM to get them is.  The compressed tar
file is about 150k long, and the zipped file is about 100k long.  The link
to the FTP site is slow, but reliable.

Finally, the FTP site has nothing to do with the Challenge.  They have
simply given me permission to place the files there.

Good Luck!

I would be much more worried if they came from a country with an
aggressive totalitarian-minded government which puts more into spook
stuff than the Finnish gov's total budget.  Not to say that every mail
between the anon service and USA wouldn't be analyzed, though, or that
the corresponding Finnish agencies wouldn't be interested - but they
simply don't have similar amounts of money and devotion to put into
it.

I suggest followups be posted to rec.xenophobia, rec.paranoia or
rec.bashing-governments.

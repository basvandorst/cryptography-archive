Hi there,
			I am not sure if thei posting is relevant to this list or not,
but here goes any way! If any reader knows of somewhere more suitable
for it, please pass it on.

I have recently been considering the prospects of using Parallel Distributed
Processing networks for encryption. It seems to me that by employing PDP nets
it should be possible to generate code which is basically undecipherable by
almost any means. Unless one was supplied with the key to decipher it, there
would be no hope of ever breaking messages so encoded. Unfortunately, I do not
have the time to write the routines to actually get such a system up and
running. I would very much like to know if anyone could break such code -
I'm pretty certain they could not. The only way to find out though would be
via a challenge. Is there anyone interested in such stuff out there?

I have done alll the theoretical work for such a system, all that is 
required is someone with the time and the technical expertise (especially
in the area of connectionist networks, but that is not to hard to get) to
implement my ideas. Any takers?

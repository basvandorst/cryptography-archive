Sounds good in theory but I have removed the invalid key from my
servers at least twice a day for the past several days. Like Vesselin
said, it's like a virus. Anybody that decides to send their entire
public keyring to the server invariably has the bad key as part of
their public keyring if they have done any trading of public keyrings.

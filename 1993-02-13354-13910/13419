Exactly.

When they tap the radio signal, they're not getting a full call.  The
signal doesn't propagate very far -- that's why there are so many cells.

If they did a legal tap, they'd get the full call -- because the phone
system doesn't shuttle calls around, the cellular provider has to.  In the
wired system, there is a single point where the whole call can be heard.
(There are several, I assume -- including the handset of the person on
the other end of the call.)

It must not be that they're being lazy -- too lazy to get a court order.
A lazy person would want a full call handed to him over a normal phone line.

If they're not being lazy, they must just be being crooked.

Sure sounds like Nixon-style government........ :-(

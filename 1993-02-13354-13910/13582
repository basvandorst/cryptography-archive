There is no proof that DES or RSA or any other cipher (with key
shorter than message) is secure.  (I will surely be flamed if wrong).
Then again, none of these have been broken either (yet).

I previously posted a PRNG using R[i] = MD5(R[i-1]+key) and nobody
poked any holes in it.  It is postulated that finding x from MD5(x)
requires 2^128 operations (i.e. brute force), so breaking either of
of these MD5 ciphers is equivalent to breaking MD5.

You are right.  Finding k from R[i]=MD5(k+i) doesn't help me refute
either MD5 postulate.  (The other is that finding x1 != x2 such that
MD5(x1) = MD5(x2) requires 2^64 operations).  I hope that since MD5
and RSA both came from the same people, that they considered sequence
based attacks.

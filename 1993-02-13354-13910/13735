Does anyone know about any particular examples of the encoding of meaning into
music?  I think I remember hearing about some examples of musical ciphers which
were hard to crack.  (Anyone ever seen "The Man with One Red Shoe"?  Also, it
seems plausible that a person could make a language out of music.  (Like in
"Close Encounters of the Third Kind")

Does anyone know of any instances of this?

I'm not up to that particular kind of challenge, but I do
have one or two practical suggestions:

1)  That Mr. Davison be asked to name the "commercially-available encryption
  algorithm".  It may be worth Mr. North's money to buy it or (certainly)
  to borrow it and spend the time figuring out the algorithm of the
  commercial package.  Besides, it may not even be a secret, proprietary
  notwithstanding.  It may be revealed in a patent application, for
  instance.  If it is, then a fair challenge would have that fact 
  revealed to Mr. North, because in a "real" cryptography situation,
  Mr. North would have that advantage.

2)  It might be worthwhile, in the absence of that, to ask Mr. Davidson
  to encrypt a couple of chosen texts (especially several files of
  binary zeroes of differing lengths) to see what you can see.  The
  key would, of course, be the same as the challenge cipher.

3)  The fact that it appears to be in UUENCODE format is probably either
  a clue or a cute deception.  Does any known software package put out
  its output in that format (besides UUENCODE itself)?  I think Mr.
  Davidson ought to explain it.  In a hobby environment, a lot of 
  constraints that happen in the "real" world don't apply and so a lot
  of cute little wild goose chases are possible.  It's easy to do 
  something that looks like fun, but is actually not really fair to the
  hobby solver.  In fact, it is easy to do something prosaic that is not
  really fair to the hobby solver.  The system may be too strong for a
  ciphertext only attack.  If so, Figuring out the system from the ciphertext
  would be a notable achievement, in that case, but Mr. Davidson might
  not be impressed and Mr. North could spend hundreds of hours on it,
  and probably not be satisfied, either.

4)  Given #3, I would be wary of some form of "cute" pseudo-encryption.
  Have you tried viewing the data as a graphics image in GIF, TIFF, etc.?
  Some who make these challenges (especially under the conditions given)
  do not always play totally fair.  They may stretch the definition of
  "key" and "algorithm" well past the breaking point.  And, digitizing
  a page of "The Codebreakers" would be easily done.

Anyway, the "commercial" software could be rubbish, or it could be a
trivial variation of FEAL-8, which is barely solvable, but with rather more
effort than I would be willing to put in.  But, I sure wouldn't take this
on with one hand tied behind my back unless analysis revealed, pretty
strongly, that it was a trivial system.

Have you run a standard frequency count or an Index of Coincidence?

Have you estimated the average byte count of a page of "The Codebreakers"?
Does it match the ciphertext?

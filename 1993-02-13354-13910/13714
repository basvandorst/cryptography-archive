Well I have been reading the RSA (USA) patent, (A big thankyou to the person
who sent posted me it (snail mail) I unfortunately lost your email so I
cannot reply to you directly that I got it!) Anyway from reading it it appears
that it is slightly hardware specific (in the patent) ie one end should
be connected to a terminal. Clearly all other cases will not be covered. 
Also it goes on about the cipher channel having the power modulus performed
on it directly, perhaps (I have not read it very closely) it could be
chelleged because PGP ciphers a cipher key and not a channel. 

Also the power modulus is written into int libraries if one could still be
found that predates the patent (sep 20 1983) The a good grounds would be
that the Idea (power modulus) is not "novel" and so the patent would be set
aside. As they is the only real thing that RSA is based on the system would
then be puplic, a few ways to generate keys may not be usagable but who
cares?

Discuss?

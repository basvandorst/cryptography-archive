: ------------------------
To prove a encryption system secure you must make three asumptions.

(1) The attacker knows your algorithm.

(2) The attacker has copies of your encrypted data.

(3) The attacker has a plaintext copy of a portion of your encrypted data.

If you can't meet this test then you are only secure until something like
the Pueblo falls into enemy hands and then everything that you have ever sent 
is compromised.

To attack your system with a known plaintext attack you simply take the plain
text and start encrypting it with your algorithm. After each step you compare
it with the encrypted data. Eventually you will find a 99.9% match with only
1 to 128 bits different. You now have the length and the flipped key bits.

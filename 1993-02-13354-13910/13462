Summary: Can an author be recognized by his/her style

David Sternlight asks is there a "profile" that can be used
to identify authors. Several statisticians have worked on
disputed authorship questions with some success. I may not
be up to date. The classic is Mosteller and Wallace's work on the
Federalist papers. The question concerns a group of papers that
could have been written by Hamilton or Madison. They have a long
article in the Journal of the American Statistical Association in
the early sixties. A book [1964] _Inference and Disputed Authorship:
The Federalist_. and an introductory article in  Statistics: A Guide to
the Unknown_.

Brad Efron and colleages have looked at some work attributed to
Shakespear using vocabulary estimates. I don't have references for
this but they would be easy to find.

My opinion is that given pretty good sized samples, you can come
up with statistical evidence in favor or against a specific author
or a small set of authors. General recogition is probably not
practical at this time.

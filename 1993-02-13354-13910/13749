This may not be exactly what you're looking for, but: 

I tried to get a thread going a while back about embedded data in music, 
with some examples being things like modem data streams, fax, or 
morse code. I don't have the specifics, but a Mike Oldfield lp supposedly
contains a morse code message that carries an insult or kiss-off to 
his old boss. 

Some recent techno release or fairly popular band has some modem data
in a track of theirs. And my ears perk up on listeing to some Brian
Eno where I think I hear faxes or modems connecting, perhaps triggering
subconscious associations in my mind (for example, supposedly Eno once
used some car keys in some of his ambient music as a subliminal trigger
to make people want to leave or to expect some resolution). 

Sorry I can't cite specific tracks and details, but it's something
at least. I'd like to see a list of stuff like this compiled. I suspect
there must be a lot of older music with Morse code messages and 
a lot of other messages buried in music.

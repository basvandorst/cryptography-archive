Ive heard discussion on this because, and am looking for papers, references
and source code. Bascially, the encryption process would work like this:

 take a normal ascii message
 take some specified (secret) document
 use an algorithm (using frequency analysis or biased by some special key)
  to substitute words in the original ascii document

This kind of encryption is (IMHO) somewhat interesting, as it maybe possible
to substitute the original message with something that is very hard (or 
at least not easy for anything automated) to determine that it is actually
encrypted.

Any pointers? 

Matthew.

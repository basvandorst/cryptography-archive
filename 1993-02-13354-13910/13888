   Take your message and use it as an intitial state for a gas state. Run it
   through the lattice gas algorithm until it reaches equilibrium.

   2.
   Flip some bits in the resulting (thermalised gas)


   The key is the location and number of bits that were flipped, along with
   the number of steps the gas was evolved (one can even flip some bits,
   simulate for some more time-steps and flip some more bits)

   To decode just flip the same bits, reverse all speeds and run the simulation
   for the same number of steps as it was run during the encoding.
   The message will "spontaneously" appear.

Doesn't this give a trivial way to recover the key from known plaintext?
Just run the simulation for however many steps, then see which bits
were flipped.

   because the number of bits is conserved through the gas evolution
   it would be better if the message is padded with enough FF's or 0s
   to make the number of ones equal to the number of zeroes.

Besides the number of bits being conserved (at least until the bit
flipping operation at the end), the energy and momentum in the gas are
also conserved.  This gives away much more information than just the #
of 0's and 1's.  An improvement might be to enlarge the gas lattice,
add a (reversable) slow heat source, and cook until some specific
temperature is reached.

The approach does sound interesting; there are probably ways around
all these problems.

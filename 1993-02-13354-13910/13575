I was imprecise in my wording.  I meant to say:

"The government doesn't allow use by its own diplomatic, military, etc.
agencies, of OTPs based on PRNGs.  I don't know this first-hand, even,
only from talking to people who should know, and indeed claim to know.

Sorry for the confusion, hope we don't have another outbreak of
paranoia, and the S/N stays high.  I have enjoyed this group
lately.

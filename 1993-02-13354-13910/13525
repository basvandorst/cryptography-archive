The encryption of private traffic seems to be tagged (in my memory) under
'rules concerning amateur radio.'  It would be easy to verify that ham radio
isn't permitted to encrypt traffic; simply read the CFRs.  (As I recall,
_ASCII_ was considered encryption for a while... part of the reason I got
fed up with ham-purists and walked away from the whole mess).

The factoid of international treaties is tagged the same way; I seem to recall
reading something stating that amateur radio in all countries is supposed to
remain in the clear.  I can't seem to find a reliable tag for non-amateur/
non-government traffic.... (it's been 15 years or so, after all).

The exception for military traffic is easy to brush off -- no country will
sign a treaty (or expect another country to honor) any treaty that directly
reduces its ability to defend itself.

I remember there was some grumbling a few years ago because the (then extant)
Soviet Union was encrypting test data from _ballistic missile launches_.  If
the U.S. can expect the U.S.S.R. to broadcast engineering test data on weapons
tests in the clear, where does that leave most other broadcasters?

(BTW, the latter is a _stabilizing_ influence.  A country is less likely to
decide its only option is a preemptive strike if it knows the accuracy of
the enemy's weapons... instead of worse-case guesses from its own extremists).

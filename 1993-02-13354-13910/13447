i'm not sure exactly what the headers for MIME look like, but 
wouldn't it be a good idea to just make PGP use standard MIME 
delimiters? that would make it compatible with existing readers (just 
define a new application or whatever) & when those braindead news 
servers get fixed for MIME they'll get fixed for PGP too.

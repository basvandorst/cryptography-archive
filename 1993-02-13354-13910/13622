Better than PKZIP 1.1, worse than PKZIP 2.04whatever -ex, but rather
slow, especially when you use encryption. If you don't use encryption,
it's about two times slower than Info-ZIP's zip.

Relatively recent, I think - I've heard about it less than a year
ago...

Dunno. I am still playing with it. Has good enough compression and
extremely good encryption/authentication. I like it and would like to
see it become popular, but it is still far from that... I would also
like it to become faster, but I'm not certain that this is possible...

The best I liked is its strong encryption scheme and its ability to
provide public-key encryption and authentication. It uses PGP's public
keys, so if two people are using PGP, they could exchange publicly
encrypted and authenticated archives with HPACK. The secret key
encryption is different, however - it is not DES and not IDEA. It is
an MD5-based cypher; I think it was discussed on sci.crypt. Maybe the
author, Peter Gutmann, could provide more information.

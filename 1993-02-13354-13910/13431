But they _do_ all go to a central switch.  True, there may be many
cell-stations, but all calls are sent to a central control switch
before being handed off to the main PSTN.  Why are things done this
way?  Because there is a seperate billing system, which validates
users, and also seperate addressing that does not get handled by the
main PSTN switches.  

It's just lazyness on the part of the Govt. that makes them 'need' to
keep things unencrypted.

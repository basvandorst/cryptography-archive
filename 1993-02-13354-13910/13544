I would definately recommend that _anyone_ who owns a cell phone
get access to a 900 MHz scanner (oh, yeah, you might have to cut
a few diodes...)

Of course, I don't own a scanner, but accidently overheard a friend's
scanner.  The amount of very private conversations going on in a metro
area such as DC is amazing!  Handoffs don't happen very often unless
you are on an interstate.  The things heard are mind boggling...
sex-lines, arguments, business discussions of questionable legality,
etc.  

Cell phones are _not_ secure...be very careful what you say on them!
(Of course, as soon as I realized what it was, I demanded my friend
turn off his scanner.  To think _he_ had the nerve to intercept
electromagnetic waves propogating through his _own internal organs_.
How dare s/he! )

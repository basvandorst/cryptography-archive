>>Also, can anyone provide pointers to DES VLSI?

Try calling VLSI Tech.  and asking for info on their VM007 chip.
(Sorry, I don't have the number handy, but they should be on the NCSC
EPL.)  I believe the VM007 is the fastest chip around (at least in the
US).  Another speed demon is the SuperCrypt chip from Computer
Elektronik Infosys GmbH (U.S.  office at 703 435-3800).

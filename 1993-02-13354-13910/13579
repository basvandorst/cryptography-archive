As you note, it is a stabilizing influence.  The agreement not to encrypt
such telemetry was part of a bilateral treaty -- one of the SALT treaties,
as I recall.  It was never ratified, due to political problems at both
ends, but both sides more or less stuck with the provisions anyway.
When relations between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. got tense, they started
encrypting the telemetry, as a form of pressure.  Etc.

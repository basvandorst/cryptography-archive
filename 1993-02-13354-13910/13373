Well, it means that if you want to check who a message came from you
have to ask the sender for the actual signature and check it against the
hash.  I think it's a step forward on the huge signatures we're getting.
I also think life would be happier if PGP were integrated with RFC822,
but I don't know if that's ever likely to happen given it was originally
an MS-DOS thing...

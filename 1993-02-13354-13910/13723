These are probably faq's, but I haven't seen that posted, so ...

FIRST:

Lots of messages here are in the form

-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
lots of plaintext here ...


-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----
Version: 2.1

lots of armored ascii here ...
-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----

I have pgp v2.1 (I've seen Version: 2.1e).

I assume that the signature is obtained via pgp -sba myfile, which creates
 myfile.asc. With version 2.1, that armored ascii is surrounded by 
-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----, -----END PGP MESSAGE----- and not any of the
 above bracketing lines. Is that just a version difference or is it manual
 editing?

Also, is there a pgp option that will combine the plaintext and the
 signature for that into one file (that would look like many of the posts in
 this conference)? Is there a pgp option that can simply be given such a
 combined file, so that pgp can find the signature and the signed message
 and check them? Or do I have to cut the signature apart from the message
 and then run pgp on the signature (telling it the file name I used for the
 cut apart plaintext portion)? Does one cut exactly between the bracketing
 lines (inclusive or exclusive)?

SECOND:

If one is not supposed to trust that a public key presented by other than
 soneone I trust, then whuffo all these signed messages? Is one expected to
 have gathered trusted public keys from many/all who post here?

Thanks.

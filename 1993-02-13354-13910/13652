 Well, I guess I basically intended this to question why most of
 the hash functions we see are based on S-P technology rather than
 the range of technologies which are available.  That is, if we
 are willing to accept that repeated applications of a S-P cipher
 function are better than one, why don't we see other cipher
 technologies applied repeatedly in a similar way?

 Since other cipher technologies are clearly stronger than a single
 S-P "round," why do we have repeated applications of S-P functions
 instead of repeatedly applying the stronger technologies?

 As Jerry mentioned:

 So perhaps my statement got overlooked:

 [ Then Jerry describes "mixing functions" . . . . ]

 See pictures in Sloane [2:75].  Also, Sloane ascribes
 "transformations of this type" to "ergodic theory" [2:74].

 I, for one, would like to see someone describe "ergodic theory"
 (with respect to cryptography).  Are there any "ergodic" results
 which can be applied to the analysis of DES or MD5?

 OK.  *Does* MD5 use the "right" number of "rounds"?

 Product encipherment predates Shannon.  Indeed, he says:

    "Product encipherment is often used; for example, one follows
    a substitution by a transposition, or a transposition by a
    Vigenere, or applies a code to the text and enciphers the
    result by substitution, transposition, fractionation, etc."
    [1:671]

 Frankly, it doesn't take a whole lot of insight to suspect that the
 product of two different ciphers will probably be stronger then
 either, and almost certainly cannot be weaker.

 But Shannon certainly does *not* describe "alternating substitutions
 and permutations"; instead, he speaks of the sequential application
 of entire ciphers, once each.  He says:

    ". . . these combining operations of addition and multiplication
    apply to secrecy systems as a whole."  [1:672]

 So what does happen when we just re-apply *the same* fairly-weak
 cipher (the way S-P technology does)?  Do we have the same
 assurances?   To some extent, Shannon does address this:

    "A system whose M and E spaces can be identified, a very
    common case as when letter sequences are transformed into
    letter sequences, may be termed endomorphic." [1:672]

    "The set of endomorphic ciphers with the same message space
    and the two combining operations of weighted addition and
    multiplication" [that is, the product of two ciphers] "form a
    linear associative algebra with a unit element...."  [1:673]

 To me, the scary part of this is the term "linear" to describe
 the algebra of repeated applications.


>So Shannon's insight seems to have been born out in
>practice.

 Well, this particular "Shannon insight" was the development of an
 algebra to describe the existing practice of "product encipherment"
 [1: 671], rather than any prediction that there would be some
 "right" number of repetitions in a cipher which repeatedly
 applies weak inner transformations.

As was pointed out to me a while back, there's still a privacy issue.
If I know the input data for someone else -- and that's not hard; see
the SSN FAQ -- I can construct the same hash function, and match that
against the database.

Btw, it's worth asking the CDC folks what they mean by ``accurate''.
Some errors are acceptable for most of their needs as long as the
margin of error is bounded, and the bound is low enough that they can
can ``no more than X% duplications''.

Well you could 'sign' your message in a way that is unique to both the message
itself and to your secret key (that we'll say the Evil Empire can't get at).
All the Evil Empire (or your friend) can do is, using the public key you sent,
to check that you do have its secret partner.

Aha! says you, but the Evil Empire could do exactly the same by 'signing' with
their secret key?

Now the denoument. When your friend receives message and key, he uses the 
encryption system to produce a hash of the public key he has received.
He then voice calls you and since you can produce (probably keep stored) the 
identical hash of your public key, it's quick to check that the key he has 
received is not the key you sent. Enemy Action! The Evil Empire is foiled
again. Of course, if your encryption system won't make a short hash of this sort, 
your friend could always fax you a copy of what he received as a key. PGP
has such a utility though; why not pick up a copy and try it?

Just so you stay a little afraid of the dark though......
If you know your friend really well, no problem. But if he's a new friend or 
even an Internet friend who you've never even met.....  Well, you can be 
satisfied that, whoever they are they sent you the key, but how trustworthy are
they? Do you really *know* who you are talking to???? And what they do???

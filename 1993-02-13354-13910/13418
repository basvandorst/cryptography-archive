        Too true!  I tried a PC shareware program called Iris which
        does true RSA encryption of the full message.  On a 16MHz
        386sx, to encrypt a 32k text file using what it called a '300
        digit key - I guess around 1024 bits), took 5 hours!!  It
        took nearer 50 minutes on my 33MHz 486dx at home, but that's
        still a tad slow :-)

If the Evil Empire knows what verification schemes you are using, there
really isn't any simple way.  The only thing I can think of is, at some
point, send a complex computer program that generates (part of) the key,
or which works and contains (part of) the key.  The Empire would have to
rewrite the program.  (If you send computer programs, the Empire would have
to decode any binary message to see if it is a program which generates a
key, and change that program, as well ... this is theoretically possible,
but may require more time than the Empire has available.)

If you set up the verification scheme in advance without the Empire
knowing, there is no difficulty in detecting the interception.  For
instance, if you send first two messages A and B.  Then send a key C
such that C decrypts with an encryption function which is not involutory
(g(f(msg,key1),key2) = msg with g not similar to f) A to B, or B to A.  If
you can send ONE BIT of information later, saying which direction the
encryption is, you may be able to detect spoofing of the A-B message.

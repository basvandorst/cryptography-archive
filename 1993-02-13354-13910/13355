At the recent RSA conference there was some mention of a (Swiss?)
company named (I think) Cryptologia.  Does anyone know anything about
this company and, if so, could they send me some information about it.
Like an address and some idea of what kind of products or services it
produces?  I found nothing (except references to the magazine) in
Nexis, so any help will be appreciated.  Thanks.

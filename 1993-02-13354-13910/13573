One problem is whatever key you come up with essentially becomes a
new identifier for that person.  Even if you can't undo the key, a list
key => person could be kept (trust?).  I could even see another spot on the
insurance form for "CDC number" right next to the SSN.  I suppose CDC
could issue some fairly strict rules about doctors disclosing any such
key.  But to catch duplicate reporting the "secret" of key=>person would
be known by every doctor that person uses.  If you can bribe or steal the
information, why bother breaking the key.

Ok, lets assume the patient trusts the doctor (if the doctor is going to leak
that the patient has AIDS anyway, the secrecy of the key is a moot point).

Another problem is if you use information that is known, then someone
else could take that same information, the formula, and calculate the 
key.  This is essentially the same as the dictionary attack on passwords.
In your example, anyone who knew name/dob/ssn could encrypt them to find
the key and then examine the list to see if it appears.  You could
add in some "salt" by asking the patient for a 4(6,8,12,etc)-character
PIN, and hope he/she doesn't choose a different one for every doctor.  If
you trust the doctor, can you trust the patient?

How do you let only one person choose a key, and let only one key be
choosen by a person without knowing who chose which key.

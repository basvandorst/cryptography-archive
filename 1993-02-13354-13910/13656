Our favorite cryptheads, Alice and Bob, are apparently moving into
physics as well.

In the latest "Scientific American," March 1993, in an article
entitled "Black Holes and the Centrifugal Force Paradox," we find the
following: 

"To develop the proper intuition about circular light rays, imagine
two astronauts (say, Bob and Alice) who conduct experiments inside a
space station built around a black hole....Bob has measured the
curvature...

"Imagine that Alice attaches a ..." (and so on)

Perhaps this trend is not surprising, as multi-party protocols are
often confusing in any terms, and the "anthropomorphizing" of
scenarios with Bob, Alice, Eve, etc., is often at least a slight aid.

Will we soon see "Two geologists, Alice and Bob, are walking along a
rift zone...." or "Bob and Alice, astronomers, are travelling to Alpha
Centauri."?

Crypt once again leads the way!

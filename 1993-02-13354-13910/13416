While I'm no expert on cellular communications, I think that the nature
of "cellular" systems precludes just tapping the base stations. Because
the phones are mobile, the call is handed-off from one cel to another when
the phone moves from one area to another. Often, a city will have dozens
of different cels. If you tap the base station, or cel, you will only get
part of the conversation if the phone moves to another area. I suppose
blanket tapping of *all* landlines, microwaves, etc from *all* base
stations would defeat this, but it sounds like only something the FBI
would do. But then again, I'm no expert. The tapping possibilities would
change if all the cels were connected by landline to a main exchange
where the calls would connect to the phone company's system.

No need to do that; we've found him. We've even got his office and
private phone numbers. Sorry, no fax or e-mail. I spoke with him. He
told me that the evaluation of PGP has been ordered by a commercial
customer but the results have been never published. He claims that the
person who has published the original electronic message has done this
incompetently and without permission. (Actually, he used the word
"stollen".) He refused to make -any- comments about any deficiencies
in PGP, except that he insists on his results and won't supply any
further information.

Regards,
Vesselin

      I remember seeing a recommended general solution for your
   problem, though it's of little use to you now.  Immediately after
   generating your key pair, generate a key-revokation certificate.
   Send it to someone you trust, perhaps encrypted with IDEA so that
   you haveto give them a password/key to allow them to revoke your
   key....

If the revocation certificate is encrypted with a password, why does
it have to go to someone you trust instead of just going on a public
server?  It could even be generated automatically with your key pair,
and attached to your public key like a key signature certificate.

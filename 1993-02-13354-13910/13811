This is a fraught area, because not only do national laws vary but, according 
to my recently received mails, also local (e.g. US State) laws.

In specific regard to your observation, I believe that national (and local?) 
requirements vary enormously. In some places it is necessary to inform the 
target that he is being tapped; in others the target must be informed that a
tapping operation has been carried out; yet, in others, there is no requirement
to advise the target of anything at all. Finally, there are places where
for 'warrants' one might read 'carte blanche'.

I am not sure that moves to make watertight legislation in regard to the 
control of eavesdropping - legal or otherwise - can ever succeed. The 
potential rewards are too great and the chances of detection of illegal 
application (often) too slim. Criminalizing an activity does not, per se, 
prevent it; only a serious risk of detection can do that.

I think my own view is that efforts should be concentrated on allowing both 
individuals and corporate bodies to make their own arrangements for the 
'security' of their information, according to their perceived needs. This 
would include the use of encryption methods of choice.

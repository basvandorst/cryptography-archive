Vesselin is exactly correct! I made a mistake. A human error. I wasn't
paying attention to what I was doing at the time and I should have
been more careful. Thank you for clearing this up Vesselin. BTW I
never saw the original posting or received the original message. I
think they got dropped in-transit somewhere. All I can say is that
shortly after, I realized that mail was not getting to or coming from
your site for about a week. FTP didn't work either. But all seems to
be fine now.

At any rate, Vesselin has righted my wrong, cleared my error
condition, etc. and I don't think there should be any more questions
as to the authenticity of my plea. It is now up to the reader to make
their own decision. I want to thank Vesselin again for taking the time
to clear up this mess and being so patient with my errors. It's a
learning process for all of us. As we become more familiar with the
software and it's intricacies, the mistakes will become fewer and more
far between occurances.

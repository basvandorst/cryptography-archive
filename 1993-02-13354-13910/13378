I once read about a Mechanism which was considered to verify serial Numbers
painted on nuclear Weapons put under mutual Control: All over the serial
Number, paint a Layer of a special Color. This Color contains colored Par-
ticles which will "lump together" when the Paint dries, thus creating a
random three-dimensional Pattern. All you have to do is maintain a Data-
base with Photographs of these Patterns; To verify a Number, check that
1) The Pattern is in Fact made of the mentioned Paint,
2) The Pattern matches the one in the Database.

Has this been dumped? Why?

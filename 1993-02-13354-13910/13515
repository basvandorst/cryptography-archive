The password crypt function takes the users password as the encryption key
and uses it to encrypt a 64-bit block of zeros. The result is treated the
same way and so on (25 times total). The result (64 bits) is unpacked
into a character string of 11 chars and this string is compared with the
corresponding string in /etc/passwd.

To make it impossible to use DES-hardware in a brute force attack, the
DES tables are modified. Additionally two charcaters are
added to the users password. These two chsaracters, called salt,
are used as the two first chars before encryption. The salt is a 
12 bit number and assigned to the user, every time he changes his
password. It is also stored in /etc/passwd.

This information is from Simson/Garfinkels "Practical Unix Security",
where a more detailed description is given.

Regards,
Sebastian.

You are probably aware of this but if Diffie-Hellman or a varient were
used, the tapping would have to be on the clear side of the base station.
For that matter, if the base station then feeds into the public switched
network tapping is a trivial matter anyway.  Anybody that believes it
requires a court order is naive indeed.  It only requires a court order
pragmatically if the tap information is to be used publicly.  If it is
"merely" part of surveilence then consider it routine.  Taps are only
used to gain enough information to obtain "hard" evidence and then there
is no need to disclose that a tap was ever used.

Peace,

Bob

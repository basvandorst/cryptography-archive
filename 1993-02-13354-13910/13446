People have been saying this is a bad idea because it defeats the security
that you use PGP to obtain.. One quick suggestion is that you could have two
PGP keys (I mean two set), a HUGE one for all the security you ever think you
need, and a 64 or so byte key for just sending mail back and forth without
nosy sysadmins reading it.

If all someone wishes to talk about is what time the party at your house if
going to start, they use the short key. If someone wishes to talk to you
about something important then they can send you mail and request a copy of
your full size key..

This would cut a lot of traffic down because people wouldn't have to sign all
their message with a monster signature, and they would also have all the
security that they got a copy of PGP for.

P.S. This has already been done in a way by people signing messages with
'mail me for PGP key', this would just remove that step (and encryption time)
for trivial messages.

*******************************************************************************

PinePGP is a series of scripts that allow you to integrate PGP with
the PINE mail program.

You need to be running pgp 3.92 to decrypt, as it uses the new filter
function, but earlier versions should be able to encrypt, as the
encryption is just set as an external editor.

To use PinePGP, copy the files pgpdriver, mailpgp, and unpgp to the
/usr/local/bin directory.
Create the directory .mailpgp in your home directory, and make sure
that the envirionmental variable $EDITOR is a valid editor.
PGP is assumed to be in your path.

Finally, edit your .pinerc to reflect the following values:

*******************************************************************************
feature-list=enable-alternate-editor-cmd,
	enable-alternate-editor-implicitly,
	enable-unix-pipe-cmd

editor=mailpgp

display-filters="-----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----" /usr/local/bin/unpgp _TMPFILE_

*******************************************************************************

That's it!  You can now send and recieve pgp encrypted messages.

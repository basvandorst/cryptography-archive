<H3>CLEARSIG: enable signed messages to be encapsulated as
  clear text</H3>
<P>Default setting:  <CODE>CLEARSIG = on</CODE>
<P>Normally, unencrypted PGP signed messages have a signature
certificate prepended in binary form.  Also, the signed message is
compressed, rendering the message unreadable to casual human eyes,
even though the message is not actually encrypted.  To send this
binary data through a 7-bit E-mail channel, radix-64 ASCII armor is
applied (see the ARMOR parameter).  Even if PGP didn't compress the
message, the ASCII armor would still render the message unreadable to
human eyes.  The recipient must use PGP to strip the armor off and
decompress it before reading the message.
<P>If the original plaintext message is in text (not binary) form, there
is a way to send a signed message through an E-mail channel in such a
way that the signed message is not compressed and the ASCII armor is
applied only to the binary signature certificate, but not to the
plaintext message.  The CLEARSIG flag provides this useful feature,
making it possible to generate a signed message that can be read with
human eyes, without the aid of PGP.  Of course, you still need PGP to
actually check the signature.
<P>The CLEARSIG flag is preset to <KBD>on</KBD> beginning with PGP version 2.5. 
To enable the full CLEARSIG behavior, the ARMOR and TEXTMODE flags
must also be turned on.  Set ARMOR=ON (or use the <KBD>-a</KBD> option), and set
TEXTMODE=ON (or use the <KBD>-t</KBD> option).  If your config file has CLEARSIG
turned off, you can turn it back on again directly on the command
line, like so:
<PRE>
     pgp -sta +clearsig=on message.txt
</PRE>
This message representation is analogous to the MIC-CLEAR message type
used in Internet Privacy Enhanced Mail (PEM).  It is important to
note that since this method only applies ASCII armor to the binary
signature certificate, and not to the message text itself, there is
some risk that the unarmored message may suffer some accidental
molestation while en route.  This can happen if it passes through
some E-mail gateway that performs character set conversions, or in
some cases extra spaces may be added to or stripped from the ends of
lines.  If this occurs, the signature will fail to verify, which may
give a false indication of intentional tampering.  But since PEM
lives under a similar vulnerability, it seems worth having this
feature despite the risks.
<P>Beginning with PGP version 2.2, trailing blanks are ignored on each
line in calculating the signature for text in CLEARSIG mode.

	I take your point, but if you don't mind, I have a follow up.
	This probably gets close to an FAQ (maybe there should be a
	random number FAQ).  Suppose you sampled the original 10**6
	RAND random numbers by some algorithm (calculate the start
	position using a method involving a variable or two known to
	transmitter and recipient, the sort of thing the Russians gave
	Abel and Hayhanen) and move through the list using one of those
	algorithms (e.g., move up or down using the value to the left, and
	right or left using the value to the right).  If you need to sample
	1000 numbers, then you have something of the order of

	(10**6)!/(10**3)!.(999,000)!

	possible selections.  This seems to me to be an extremely large
	number of keys to test.  Would such a sampling method not shake
	off the pseudorandom propeties of the list?  If you took a second
	list by a second algorithm and combined the two (interspersing
	values, XORing etc.), would you still be able to find the
	superencipherment?  I realise that this would be a lot of work
	if done manually, but I'm just plain curious.

	Alec

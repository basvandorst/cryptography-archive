CLIPPER was announced (prematurely?) on April 16.  On the morning of the 19th
AT&T told one potential buyer at the ISSA/CardTech/SecureTech show that
they would make DES units available to buyers but only until they could be
replaced by CLIPPER units.  By the afternoon of the 19th they were no 
longer making even that offer.  There would be no 3600 DES units ever.

Current rumor has it that the yield on CLIPPER chips has been very low.  No
surprise there.  What will surprise anyone who has tried to do business
with NSA is if AT&T ever sees any small percentage of the 10K unit
orders that they sold out for.

This is not encryption at all in the conventional sense.  What the scheme
does is just to conceal the existence of a hidden message from those who
don't know how the scheme works.  In fact, you don't even have an encryption
key.

I've seen schemes like this being mentioned in this group in the past.  
I suspect that almost everyone interested in cryptology has thought
about schemes like this at some point.

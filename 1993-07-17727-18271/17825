Hey...

How about creating a sci.crypt.technical but instead of having a new
newsgroup just have a moderator toss all the technical/research posts in
there, lifting them out of the regular sci.crypt --

That way all you geeky researchers won't have to read through the
drivel posted by all you froth-and-flame politico types.

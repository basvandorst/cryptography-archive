Why the compress step- I suspect it would introduce more information
into the stream rather than less.
ps With something like the fast software DES (about 10^5 DES crypts/sec
on a Sparc 10, say 10^4 on a PC) you have 1GB in about 1 day.

To say whether yor plan is good one would have to know what it's purpose
is. For just generating a random stream, I would think almost any
moderately good hash function wold be OK

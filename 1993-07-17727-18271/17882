William B. Robinson is Director of the Office of Defense Trade Controls
in the State Department. The power of the President to control arms 
exports and imports is delegated to the Secretary of State, who in turn 
delegates it to Robinson. Furthermore, Robinson has the authority to
modify the International Traffic in Arms Regulations at his whim.

A few months ago, and again last week, I asked Robinson whether the
State Department regulates the permanent import of defense articles.

Here is his answer, in toto: ``The Department of State regulates the
permanent export, temporary export, and temporary import of defense
articles. Permanent imports of defense articles, governed by the U.S.
Munitions List, into the United States are regulated by the Department
of the Treasury (27 Code of Federal Regulations or CFR 47, 178, and
179).''

In particular, unless the Treasury Department sticks a tariff on PGP,
you can freely import the PGP code.

The ``crypto import is illegal'' myth has persisted despite the best 
attempts of John Gilmore and others to kill it. I hope the statement 
from Robinson puts the final nail into its coffin.

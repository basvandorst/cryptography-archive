Would appreciate any info on (or pointer to) two products/devices that I've
recently heard vague reports about.
	- Isolation - product/vendor name?? - supposedly performs encryption
over ethernet links, project may be being evaluated/produced in Canada with
possible assistance from NSA/NCSC ??
	- Face To Face - product/vendor name ?? - supposedly performs
encryption for video over networks/links ??

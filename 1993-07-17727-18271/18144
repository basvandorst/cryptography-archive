I was recently challenged to out any information about work being done
on the ISO non-repudiation service for open distributed environents.
I have however drawn a blank on this matter. Is there anyone out there
who has done anything about this service or is it just being forgotten about.
I would appreciate any input from anyone in terms of published articles,
project reports, coffee stanied napkins with formal protocol specifications.

It struck me yesterday that it might be relatively simple to emulate the
commercial encryption boxes like UUNET's $6000 ($12000 the pair) Lan
Guardian by modifying the kernels on either the source and destination
systems or, better, intermediate Sun systems acting as routers. I vaguely
remember that Suns have (or can have) DES chips installed so can merrily
encrypt at high speed. The encryption could be done selectively by
source/destination address. Only the data portion would be encrypted.

Before I go more deeply into this, am I re-inventing the wheel? Has
somebody done this already, either in freeware, shareware or payware?

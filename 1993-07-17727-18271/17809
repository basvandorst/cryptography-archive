I am not a professional crypto-person, but have a modest need for data
encryption. I do not care whether the NSA (or the BKA or whatever state-run
spy-shop) reads my stuff -- they will be disappointed if they waste their
time. However, for commercial reasons, I don't want others to be able to
without spending a HUGE amount of time and money. My question is this: in
MS-DOS, is the encryption provided by PC-Tools (DES) adequate to prevent all
by the most powerful decrypters from reading my stuff. If not, is there any
advantage by encrypting it more than once, with different keys?


Thanks ....

It would also, presumably, be possible simply to publish a hash as a
classified ad in a newspaper.  Of course, one might wonder whether the
advertising staff would get it right (given their frequent inability
to get simple things like phone numbers right), but that's a somewhat
incidental issue.  My guess is that newspaper publication is more
widely recognized by courts than a PGP key-server... though the
principle remains the same, and perhaps with time electronic
"notaries" will have the same authority.  Of course, one would still
have to explain to a court how a hash works -- but I think once it was
demonstrated that it would so-and-so many thousand years on
supercomputers to fake a hash (especially with a plaintext which is
cighly constained to being predominantly natural language -- i.e. even
if a brute force attack was made to find a plaintext with an identical
hash, 99.99999...% of such plaintexts are jibberish[*]), the court would
tend to believe the hash publication proved a composition date.

Yours, Lulu...

* Another question occurs to me of a roughly cryptographic interest:
What's the chance that there exist ANY two plaintexts, both of which
are recognizable as generally in natural language (with maybe a few
jibberish typos in the middle, but no more than some amount that a
typical *bad* typist would make)? What about if we specify only texts
of length > N? What about if we specify both have length of *exactly*
N? Any feeling about this question?

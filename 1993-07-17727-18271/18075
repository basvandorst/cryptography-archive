Summary: There are "provably" secure one-way hash functions, but are they worth it?

Cryptosystems like RSA or ElGamal can be used as one-way hash functions 
if the secret key is unknown to any attackers (or if it is completely 
"lost"): If you encrypt, for instance, the first text block, XOR the result 
with the second block and encrypt again etc. etc., it will be infeasible to 
reconstruct any such intermediate results from the final checksum. Thus an 
attacker cannot make modifications to the text that leave the checksum 
intact; he or she would have to solve the factoring/discrete log problem 
first. 

Why are those systems not used as hash functions? Probably because they 
are too expensive (computationally, as it were, not licence-wise ;-) ) ...

I'm attempting to compile Dennis Ferguson's code for DES (from
ftp-site ftp.funet.fi), and I think I have mis-matched versions.  I
need to patch Eric Young's set_key.c (ftp-site ftp.psy.uq.oz.au).  I
have version 1.4 of Young's code with a patchfile written by Ferguson,
but the patch doesn't correspond to the C code that I'm trying to use
it on.  The patch doesn't have a version number, but it is the one
currently in the ftp-site ftp.funet.fi.

Could anybody suggest where I might be able to find versions that
correspond with each other?  Or, a version with Ferguson's patches
already in place?  Any help would be appreciated.

Well, a much "lower tech" approach was used by a friend who was sent
to Saudi Arabia for Desert Storm. He took a copy of Norton utilities
with him, and had the friends who were sending him stuff on floppy
just copy everything to a fresh floppy, then *delete* the files that were
"questionable". He'd get the disk, and run undelete.

*Totally* worthless if anyone suspects. :-)

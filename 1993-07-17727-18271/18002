  Has Khufu been successfully attacked to date? What are some of your 
opinions on its strength relative to, say, IDEA? (assume both are used in 
CFB mode). Source code would be appreciated, if it's available.

Email and Usenet replies both welcome.
Email is more likely to get a reply in return.

Thanks

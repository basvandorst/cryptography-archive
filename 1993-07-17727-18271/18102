In considering lossy compression of images, I'm wondering if one
could incorporate/encapsulate data into the bit stream of the
compressed image...   for example:

If I have a 12 bit per pixel image, I can "compress" it by discarding
the 4 least significant bits. I can replace the discarded 4 bits
with 4 bits from a different data stream - possibly attaching a
descriptive text of the image IN the image data.

If one were to view the 8/4 data as a 12 bit image, there may not
be a gross perterbation of the image; if one knew how to decapsulate
the 4 bits of "attached" data, this could be an interesting method
of annotation, or a (high overhead) method for encryption.

If there is work going on along these lines, could you please
contact me - or if there is interest in pursuing this, drop me a line.
Thanks, Doug

I have a question.  I understand very little about
cryptography so this may be really dumb.

I am working on a multi-user game program.  The
users all make turn files and then copy those files
to the person with the host program to run them.  The
host then runs and returns result files to the
players.

These turn and result files are all encrypted because
if any player can merely read any of the other players
files they are at a tremendous advantage.  The Host
program obviously has to have the passwords used to
decrypt the turn files and encrypt the result files.

Now the problem is that the person running the host
program is usually one of the players.

Now, it seems to me, that regardless of the encryption
method (even a true one-time pad) is breakable since
the host player can single step through the host program.
Since a one-time pad would be too cumbersome, by walking
through the decryption once they could then write a
utility to do it again in the future.

Am I missing something here or is this a situation that
can not be safely encrypted?

If it cannot be safely encrypted, am I much worse off if
I just compress and then XOR (64-bit random number using
the P/W as the seed)?  By doing this I avoid any export
restrictions

thanks - dave

I have recieved mail from Jim on this, and he will be posting soon.
To help avoid further misunderstandings, I am quoting the passage
from the Ap A of the anouncement.

My interpretation of this is that a licence will be granted for ICs
subject to

1) use of DSA
2) use of the key escrow system

Note the AND in the above.

I would love to hear that I am wrong in this, or that I am miss
interpreting it. Several people have stated that, but I hope to
hear a clear explanation. Maybe amending Ap A would also be in
order. It would not do if NIST considers KE a requirement of the
deal.

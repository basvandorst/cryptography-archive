If you can do digital filtering, you can get the spectrum of the noise and
whiten it digitally.

Of course, white noise is defined over a field -- eg., the reals.  We could
convert the raw bits to integers and pretend they're real then take the
spectrum.  However, there are different ways to do the conversion from bit
stream to integer (different sizes).

If you whiten a sample done one way, convert it back to bits and then
convert those bits to integers again (using a different radix size) how far
off will its spectrum be from white?  If you whiten that one and go back
and forth, will it converge?

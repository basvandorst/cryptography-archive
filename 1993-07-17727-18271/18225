If by 'chaos' one means wildly divergent functions 
applied in a reproducible way to a stream of 
information, then cryptography already uses chaos.

If you mean the subdicipline of functions that are
everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable,
then cryptography already uses a superset of that
math.

If you mean applying some buzzword to another buzzword
to get a two-degrees-of-freedom buzzword then, OK,
chaos and cryptography is wonderful.

But then all I want to say to you is:

chaotic crypto nanotechnology!

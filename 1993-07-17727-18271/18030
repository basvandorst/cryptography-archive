I realize that this question has been asked here in the last few months, but
I didn't happen to have the brains to take note of the responses at the
time.  
I'm looking about information about hardware implementations of various
encryption algorithms.  I'm interested in almost anything --DES, IDEA, RSA
etc...  Name and addresses of the companies that make such devices would be
appreciated.

Thanks in advance,

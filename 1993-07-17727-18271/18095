Hi folks,

I have been reading this group for a while now.  And I have noticed (in
various posts) a few allusions that Security in the Unix operating system
might not be as tight as its vendors indicate.  Perhaps some of the
knowledgeable people on this newsgroup can comment on these issues: 

(1) How difficult is it to crack a user's password (with publicly
    available crypto-analysis products)?  Minutes?  Hours?  Days? 
    Months... 

(2) Is it possible to view and manipulate protected files in the Unix file 
    system without owning them (and without being the super-user)?

(3) Is it possible to spy on a user's terminal session (to see everything
    that they see and type)?  How? 

(4) If I send an Email message (that isn't privacy-enhanced in any way)
    can it be intercepted, and read, by anyone other than the recipient
    (and super- user on the recipient's system)? 

(5) What (if anything) can be done to protect a Unix system (or individual 
    users) from these intrusions?

(6) Are there other Unix Security concerns that one should be conscious 
    of?

I am aware that these are rather open-ended questions.  If the answers
turn out to be interesting, I hope that a discussion of these issues will
get started.

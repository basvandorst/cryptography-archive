What are the benefits or drawbacks of the use of Unicode for the dictionary's character set?  One implication would be the immediate extension of the 
dictionary into foreign languages and the necessity of utilizing a larger
(32 bit?) index.  This would still produce an approximate 2:1 inherent
compression ratio.

An anonymous ftp server has been built on wocket.vantage.gte.com and will soon
be loaded with the first iteration of the dictionary release files.  Any ideas
on conducting a statistical analysis and hit ratio of the entries?  Any words
for inclusion such be submitted to my E-Mail address directly.  Please compare
your dictionaries with standard Unix 'words' and submit only the differences.

Take care.

But this has nothing to do with cryptography. It is often used to compel
one person to testify against another in all manner of criminal cases.
It is also used to coerce guilty pleas.

The one place where crypto becomes relevant, as I see it, is where one
person, call him Henry, puts a digital signature on an incriminating
message (a request for someone to kill Thomas, say). As I mentioned
earlier, the rules of evidence for verifying Henry's public key (and
hence his signature) might be very interesting.

Again, how does encrypted information differ in this regard from
information committed to memory? If Alice knows the gist of what's
contained in an encrypted message, then Alice's testimony could
eliminate the need to decrypt the message.

And if it required multiple people to decrypt the message, then the
usefulness of the crypto scheme for communicating would be diminished,
since no one could read the message without a quorum present.

I'm just starting to work on Authentication of Laptops as the
topic of my Master Thesis. It is my first contact with the issue
of Security in networks. 

If anybody has some useful information about it, knows some
people to address to, some source to look at, or likes to
discuss it, please feel free to do so. I would enjoy every 
contact I can get.

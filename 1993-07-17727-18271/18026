  This seems to be a common misperception which needs to be disabused.
  The DES algorithm was designed by an IBM team.  NSA acted as a consultant
  on matters relating to defense against differential cryptanalysis which,
  at the time, was otherwise unknown.  [Ref:  Coppersmith, Don, "The Data
  Encryption Standard (DES) and its Strength Against Attacks".  IBM Research

 Funny you should ask.
 
 I can vouch for certain incompatibilities of PGP v2.2 on a
 Stacker-ed drive, but the only aspect of the incompatibility (albeit
 an important one) is the -e <encrypt> option.  I can unencrypt and
 sign messages without mishap. When encryption is attempted, PGP leaves
 three temp files (you know, the ones with the "$" in the
 file extensions) and hangs the processor, without successfully
 encrypting the file. When preformed on a Netware v3.11 server (a
 protected area, I am supervisor and files are quickly deleted and
 purged), it behaves as it should. My travelling companion is a 80486
 DX/33 Mhz notebook, where the C: partition is un-Stacker-ed, the D:
 and E: partitions are Stacker-ed. All of my PGP is done from the DOS
 command line (I only use Windoze (tm) for all those pretty fonts ;-)
 
 Keep in mind that Netware is different from Unix in a particular
 aspect with regards to where the program operates on both disk and
 memory. With Netware, the program is executed on the local
 workstation, yet the disk resources used are at the server.
 
 I imagine that this "feature" is shared by other disk compression
 schemes, but can't say for sure.
 
 Cheers from Washington, DC.

Yes, an actual crypt question here, I hope nobody minds! :)

For those who haven't been following news.groups (most of you),
there's been massive vote fraud involved in the creation of a group.
Part of the aftermath is that people are producing vote
acknowledgements that may or may not be fraudulent (some are valid,
some probably aren't).  These are sent to voters to let them know that
their vote has been recieved, but in this case they're being used to
show that the "official" list of voters may be incomplete.
But it's just so easy to forge one once you've seen another.

Thefore, for my automatic voting package I'm considering adding an
authentication signature to each mail ack for controversial CFVs (Call
for Votes).

* The encryption key needs to change for each CFV, and will be the same
  for each vote ack on the CFV.
* The signature should only take one line.
* The source code will be available to anyone who wants it.
* Authentication only needs to be done by the votetaker and a trusted
   3rd party in case of allegations of missing votes.
* Export might be a concern...

Any suggestions?  The export restriction is a pain in the butt, so if
there's something good that can be exported that's a plus.

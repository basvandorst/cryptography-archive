Get real.

Just because you don't like what someone says doesn't mean that he is
part of a Worldwide Conspiracy To Steal Your Freedoms Away From You.  I
could understand this sort of rhetoric better if I saw a few smiley
faces mixed in, but it pains me to believe that the "Sternlight is an
NSA/PKP plant" minions are quite serious.

What I have seen from Mr. Sternlight is fairly objective opinion on the
state of cryptography with respect to the law.  Listen to them, rebut
them, or ignore them.

What I have seen from the regular DS-bashers is some objective opinion
and a lot of paranoid nonsense.  Likewise, you should listen to them,
rebut them, or ignore them.

We need a moderated conference.  I'm too used to BIX, where we keep the
signal-to-noise ratio way up there.  

Please, contribute LIGHT, not HEAT!

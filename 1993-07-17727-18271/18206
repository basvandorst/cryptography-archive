I haven't seen mention in this thread of Larry Wall's perl script to
replace passwd(1). This script checks passwords for undesirable
characteristics (i.e., things that a cracker would guess without too
much trouble) and rejects them.

The script and some discussion can be found on pp. 286-305 of the
Camel Book (Programming Perl by Larry Wall and Randal L. Schwartz,
O'Reilly & Associates, 1991).

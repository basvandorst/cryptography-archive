Finally, someone should note that steganography+cryptography has a use that is  
fairly difficult to achieve with cryptography alone, and that is defeating  
traffic analysis.  Simply post the steganographed message in some public place  
(say, Usenet).  While any number of people might read the public message, only  
those with the steganography and encryption algorithms and key can read the  
hidden message.  Thus there is no easy way to tell who the actual receiver of a  
steganographed message is.  It could be any one who read the public message.

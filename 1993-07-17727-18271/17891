     Fine with me; I could live with a 100% tariff.  200%, even....  :-)

Not really :-(  When the Feds wanted to ban machine guns in the 1930s,
since the Constitution didn't let them ban them, they started by
placing a then-exhorbitant tax (I think it was like $400) per gun.
The Supreme Court let them do it, since the Constitution did let them
tax things; then they started not having anybody around authorized to
collect the tax and issue the tax stamps you needed to prove you'd paid.
They very quickly did the same with marijuana, as well as talking lots
of states into banning it.  How do you plan to get a tax stamp on your
software, especially when you don't have a Bill of Sale?

They don't usually bother with this any more; they've discovered that
the power to "regulate interstate commerce" lets them define just
about anything as commerce, and regulate things by banning them,
and the courts have let them get away with it.

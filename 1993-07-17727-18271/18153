To make effectively hidden texts, one must use secure crypto also.
It is not enough to use only steganography.  Anyone who is trying
for truly secure communications would not, say, fail to encrypt
each text.  By using steganography it becomes possble to hide the
fact that encryptd text is changing hands.

In fact, it seems that it would be very difficult, if not impossible
to prove the existence of an encrypted, steganographic message.
If the message is plaintext, it will be easy to show its existence,
but if good encryption is used first, the data which contains the
steganographed message should appear normal.

BTW, has anyone else solved the 'hidden message' in Freidman's
Military Cryptanalysis, Part 1?  It didn't seem terrible difficult
to me, but I suppose that it wasn't meant to be.  I wish he had
put more problems in the books. Oh well...

P.S. for those of you who have solved it, this one shouldn't
take more that five minutes... ;-)

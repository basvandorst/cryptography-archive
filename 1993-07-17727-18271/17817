This is exactly one scenario that I had in mind when I suggested to 
add (albeit restricted) DH key exchange to PGP: nobody could decrypt 
any "DH-enhanced message" that you ever sent -- unless they also got 
and collected your DH tokens. 

An online connection for the DH protocol would be nice, of course; it 
could be an option with PGP to try to obtain a "live" connection (SMTP, 
for example). On the other hand I'm glad that PGP is a stand-alone 
program and doesn't need any networking interface; it makes it easier 
to install and to use. That's why an "offline DH" feature was suggested. 

Btw, I haven't seen any comments on my proposal so far (except a 
technical remark/question by D.S.). Quis tacet, placet?? The net hardly 
ever placet ... I hope I didn't deter anybody when I explicitly preferred 
technical (instead of political) comments, but I still would like to have 
these seperated, at least in different threads. (Yes, count me in for 
seperate newsgroups! I'd probably read them both, perhaps even post to 
both of them occasionally, but it would make reading and selecting much 
easier in times of intense traffic. I might favour a moderated 
sci.crypt.research, but other solutions seem acceptable as well.)

	The idea that David Sternlight is a committee is preposterous.
Firstly, he is MUCH smarter than a committee (but then so is your average
sponge) and secondly if he were a GOVERNMENT committee he would never
be able to post at anywhere near the rate he achieves; he would spend too
much time arguing with himself and covering his butt with his superiors.

	No, our David is the real thing, and whether you agree with
him or not, he's consistent, interesting, and does a good job of
presenting an opposing viewpoint.

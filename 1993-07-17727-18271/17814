Still true.  >>6.  Still true.

1.  In 1991, Rivest was party to a report that gave ElGamal- (more
generally, discrete log-) based schemes a 40-bit security advantage over
RSA.  (Public-Key Cryptography:  State of the Art and Future Directions,
E.I.S.S.  Workshop, Oberwolfach, July 1991, Final Report, Th.  Beth et
al.  eds., Lecture Notes in Computer Science 578, Springer-Verlag.  See
pages 50 and 79.)  Discrete log-based schemes are quite well respected
and are on the current front of research in cryptography.  Let's have no
more of this nonsense.

2.  Good enough.  Has anyone suggested a solution to the analogous
problem with RSA primes?  I for one wasn't convinced by Kaliski's paper.

3.  The hell it has.  (Not that I ever believed it infringed a valid PKP
patent!)

4.  The connection escapes me.

5.  But not for long.  ANSI X9.30, for example, is a good start.

6.  More nonsense.  Many of our customers are quite happy with signing
in 300 or so milliseconds and validating in 600.  And that's in software
on today's hardware with random p,q,g,k and h values; with a Pentium,
SuperSPARC, or Capstone chip, we'd of course do much better.

>>The NIST/PKP deal >>This deal is basically as follows:  >>The govt is
giving PKP its DSA patent.

On the face of it, this deal violates 35 USC 209(c)(1)(A-D) and 35 USC
209(c)(2), as well as the 1987 Computer Security Act.  We'll have to see
what happens.

Oh, yeah...  please feel free to share this with anyone.  :-)

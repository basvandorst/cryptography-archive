Correct. COCOM = NATO - Iceland + Japan + Australia, at least as of a 
year ago. However, COCOM puts pressure on other countries to set up
similar systems of export controls. Switzerland has done this to the
extent that it (like Sweden, Ireland, Finland, and Austria) has been 
granted all EAA 5(k) benefits. In other words, don't assume that you're 
not subject to export controls just because you don't live in a COCOM 
country.

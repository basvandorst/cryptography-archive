Fellow netters,
    We've been talking of how to increase the signal to noise
ratio in s.c and a.s.p. Maybe this will work: 

I've started sending "inappropriate" messages back to the sender
the same as junk mail. If I'm the only one doing this, well, they
might think I'm some sort of crackpot, but when someone gets a mailbox
full of his/her own messages back, they might get the point. 
This way no one is being censured, which is slightly better than 
going to a moderated group. 

Like with anything, this is subject to abuse by those who are immature.
I hope others join in to help fight the junk mail and pissing contests
that are all too common.

Just my $0.02,
Rudy

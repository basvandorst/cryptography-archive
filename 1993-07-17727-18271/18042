About a month ago I asked the sci.crypt readership for experience with 
implementation of IDEA, with particular emphasis on the size of the
resulting code.

Many people replied saying that they had implemented IDEA, and that the
implementation is easy. Thanks. And special thanks to the two careful
readers who provided QUANTATITIVE information, which is posted below
for the benefit of all.

I've written high-speed implementations for the 68000 and 8086.  The
68000 code size is 196 bytes, although an optimisation I discovered while
writing the 8086 code will reduce that.  The 8086 code is of similar size.

Following your call concerning the implementation of IDEA on the sci.crypt
newsgroup, I send you some data regarding one of our IDEA(64) implementation.
The implementation is written in C and is targeted to be portable on different
platforms (it was tested on Sun SPARC, VAX, PC, and Apple Macintosh).

Yours sincerely,

Following, one of [Alain's] tests of a IDEA(64) implementation.
---------------------------------------------------------

Platform:		Sun SPARC sun4c
Operating System:	SunOS 4.1.3
Source code:		C
Compilers:		cc - Sun C 4.x
			acc - Sun ANSI C 4.x
			gcc - GNU Project C Compiler (v2 preliminary)
Compiler options:	-O --> Optimatization
			-c --> Object file
Size measurement:	size command (SunOS 4.1.1)
Functions:		idea_cipher(): IDEA(64) Algorithm
			idea_encrypt_key(): Computes the 16-bit encryption
			subkeys from a 128-bit key
			idea_decrypt_key(): Computes the 16-bit decrytion
			subkeys from the 16-bit encryption subkeys
Remark:			The accent for the IDEA(64) implementation was put
			on the portability. The code runs on Sun SPARC,
			VAX, PC, and Apple Macintosh. Bit masking operations
			and 2^^16 additions could be avoided, which would
			reduce the code size (only a few % I guess).

*** Function idea_cipher()
compiler	text	data	bss	dec	hex
cc		456	0	0	456	1c8
acc		448	0	0	448	1c0
gcc		448	0	0	448	1c0


*** Functions idea_encrypt_key(), idea_decrypt_key(), idea_cipher()
compiler	text	data	bss	dec	hex
cc		1232	0	0	1232	4d0
acc		1184	0	0	1184	4a0
gcc		1088	0	0	1088	440

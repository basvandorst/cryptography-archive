Actually, there is a special reason why you can't have the
high-bit-set in your password.  In DES the key is a 56-bit
number.  The initial code in crypt takes your password and
multiplies each character by two.  This effectively left
shifts each byte one bit; thus, creating a 56-bit key
(8 bytes * 7 bits).  If the high bit was set it would just
be stripped in this process.

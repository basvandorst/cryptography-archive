Hello,

I would like some advice on DES restrictions.
I am employed by a company which produces 
software for banking institutions.  Our clients,
including international banks, would like for us
to use DES in our product.  Also they state that
they are exempt from the DES export restrictions
because they are financial institutions.

1. Is it a fact that we could use DES and export
   our software to foriegn banks and not be
   violating any laws?

2. What is the process like to receive an export license
   for DES.

Thanks!

Kell

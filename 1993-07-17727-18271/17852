It should be noted that this definition of export is taken from the ITAR
(International Trading in Arms Regulations) and is found in 22 CFR Section 
120.10.  It should be read in conjunction with Section 120.21 (c) which 
defines technical data (for the purposes of the ITAR) as: "Information, in 
any form, which is directly related to the design, engineering, development, 
production, processing, manufacture, use, operation, overhaul, repair, 
maintenance, modification, or reconstruction of defense articles [i.e., 
according to Section 120.7, any item designated on the US Munitions List, 
which is set out in Section 121.1].  This includes, for example, drawings, 
photographs, plans, instructions, computer software and ddocumentation.  
This also includes information which advances the state of the art of 
articles on the U.S. Munitions List.  This definition does not include 
information concerning general scientific, mathematical or engineering 
principles commonly taught in academia.  It also does not basic marketing 
information on function or purpose or general system descriptions of defense 
articles."

It should also be noted that the United States Munitions List (set out in 
Section 121.1) includes in Category XIII--Auxiliary Military Equipment:
"(b) Speech scramblers, privacy devices, cryptographic devices and 
software (encoding and decoding), and components specifically designed or 
modified therefore, ancillary equipment, and protective apparatus 
specifically designed or modified for such devices, components, and 
equipment."  And that it includes in Category XVIII--Technical Data:  
"Technical Data (as defined in Section 120.21) relating to the defense 
articles listed in the other categories of the United States Munitions List."

It is left as an exercise to the student to demonstrate that cryptographic 
software is technical data about itself that can be exported by giving 
a copy to a foreigner within the United States.

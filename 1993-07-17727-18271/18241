Note:  I am not in favor of key-escrow or Clipper, and don't intend to buy a  
phone that includes this "feature."  This is just curiousity.

Has any company (AT&T, perhaps) announced plans/shipping dates for consumer  
Clipper-based phones?  I assume an early application would be cordless  
phones, since no additional infrastructure is needed, just one chip in the  
base and one in the handset.  Cellular support would require the local  
cellular companies to adopt the chip, and doesn't seem feasible with the  
current analog system.  And STU-III-style secure phones wouldn't seem to be a  
large consumer market...

Any information would be appreciated.

Thanks,
Joe

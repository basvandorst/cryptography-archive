Forgive me.  You didn't make the comparison yourself.

You asked someone else to compare them for you, and after I told you
why that couldn't be done, you said 'thanks' and essentially asked the
same question again.

Your question cannot really be answered, because it depends on
incorrect assumptions.  You have not specified how you're going to be
using DES, so depending on how you do it you might be more secure than
PGP or you might be much, much worse.

The DES algorithm has been thrashed out for a long time by experts;
IDEA (which is the per-message algorithm used by PGP) is comparatively
new, I'm not sure who designed it, and someone said that he heard that
IDEA had been broken at some conference or other.  (I'm not being more
specific because it could be someone talking about a possible attack
that reduces the search space but is still impractical.)

I suggest you just go use PGP.  You probably don't want to be bothered
with generating keys and distributing them, nor do you want to be
bothered with figuring out an indicator system for signing messages,
and so on and so on and so on.

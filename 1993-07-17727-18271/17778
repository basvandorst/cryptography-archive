[long ed-style patches deleted]

Please, if you post patches, use a usable format!

No Amiga version of patch does ed-style patches because no-one has ed (the
Unix-ed, I mean). Now I have to dig up that ed clone (ked) that's part of
Raymond Brand's port of RCS... and separate your article into separate
inputs for ked, and do everything by hand, instead of just typing
`patch <article'.

Besides, this would have been less work for you too. (Just `diff -c orig
new >diffs' was all you needed to do, where orig and new are the
directories with relevant sources).

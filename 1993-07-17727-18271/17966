Not so fast, D'Artagnan

(From the ITAR)

"123.2 Imports. No defense article may be imported into the United
States unless (a) it was previously exported temporarily under a
license issued by the Office of Munitions Control; or (b) it
constitutes a temporary import/intransit shipment licensed under
Section 123.3; or (c) its import is authorized by the Department of
the Treasury (see 27 CFR parts 47, 178, and 179)."

RSA/RSAREF have been classified by the USG as defense articles.
Their export was not licensed by the Office of Munitions Control, you are
speaking about permanent imports, and the Treasury has not authorized their
import.

What's more, crypto more generally, including software, flow charts, etc.
have been classified as defense articles.

I hope we can now put the claim some have tried to sustain that imports of
crypto generally, or RSA in particular, into the U.S. are o.k., to rest.

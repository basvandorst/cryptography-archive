At first, I was intrigued.  Chaos in crypto has been bogus so far, but this
sounded like it might have substance.

It doesn't.

1.	having to keep the (sub)system secret is a security flaw

2.	a decent keyed 1-way function (or even just DES with a shared
	key) is almost certain to be stronger than this chaotic subsystem
	-- so use DES with a private key instead of a chaotic subsystem and
	get something more secure.

... or is someone claiming that a chaotic equation is a more secure PRNG
than DES?

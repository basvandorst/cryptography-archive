My estimate was a bit generous -ie it would take a minute or so for the
standard Unix dictionary. However Biggars estimate is shall we say very
generous. A complete dictionary is approx 100^8 which is many Megas of
Gigabytes. Even all letters is about 10^12= a kilo Gigabytes, and would
take 10^8 sec>1 year to crack on the fastests of workstations.

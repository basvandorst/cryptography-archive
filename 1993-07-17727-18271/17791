Well, that method is approved by both the DoD and Ministry of Defence
(UK) for wiping classified data.  This would tend to indicate that it
is certainly difficult to retrieve the data.  However, it is only
applicable to some classifications of data, so there is obviously
some doubt.  The three pass rule is intended to take into account
seeking errors on the drive, whereby a narrow stripe of data would be
left behind.  The spec uses alternating 1s and 0s to try and "burn
out" the residual signal on the disk.  I've heard of the technique
described being used to recover data from low-level formats or data
overwrites, but never from "secure" deletion.

Perhaps one of the data recovery companies on the net would care to
comment?

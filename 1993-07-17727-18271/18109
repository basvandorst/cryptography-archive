Well the time has come for me to release my first alpha. For lack
of a better name, I'm calling it fmp, which stands for FREE MP.

For those who missed the discussion a couple of weeks ago, FMP is a 
public domain implementation of a subset of the functionality of the 
GNU gmp library with a compatible interface (i.e. mpz_add, mpz_sub 
...&c.) 

The choice of functions to implement was guided by my interests
and needs. If you'd like to contribute some of the missing functions,
please do.

To obtain it, anon ftp to netcom.netcom.com
cd /pub/henderso/fmp
get fmp-0.1.tar.Z

The file "notes" in the archive contains the following:
(if you need more documentation, I suggest you read the gmp documentation).

Differences between gmp and fmp

1. fmp is considerably slower than gmp
2. fmp does not implement the following:
	all mpq_*
	internal mpn_* functions
	mpz_sqrt
	mpz_sqrtrem
	mpz_perfect_square_p
	mpz_inp_raw, mpz_out_raw
	mp_set_memory_functions
3. fmp implements the following in addition to the routines in GNU gmp.
	int mpz_jacobi(MP_INT *a, MP_INT *b)
	- finds the jacobi symbol (a/b)
4. mpz_sizeinbase often overestimates the exact value

5. To convert your gmp based program to fmp (subject to the
above), change includes of gmp.h to fmp.h and link in fmp.o 
instead of libgmp.a

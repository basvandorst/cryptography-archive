This is misleading. According to Biham and Shamir, if the oppoenent
changes their keys reasonably often, it doesn't make much
difference to the overall time taken to find the (current) key.
Note that it is only the current key that you are interested in.

This is because the analysis needs only a few (1 -- my understanding
of the algorithm is not perfect) plaintext/ciphertext pairs of pairs
to find the key. 

The worst case (if they never change keys) is 2**47 encyrptions of
2**46 plaintext pairs. There is a chance 2**-46 that any particular
plaintext/ciphertext pair of pairs will reveal the key. Thus
changing the key does not help (much) the opponent.

p.s. Take this with a grain of salt -- I'm not sure how many pairs of
pairs you need encrypted under the same key -- but I know that it is a
small number.

  I dunno; anybody out there seen the source code?

  Even if there is no back door, previous versions of RSAREF used DES to
encrypt the body of the file (public-key encryption is only done upon the
"session key" used to encrypt the body of the file, and upon the "signature
digest" used for authentication; is is not computationally feasable to apply
RSA to the entire message directly).  There is considerable suspicion of DES
in the crypto community; the arbitrary limitation of its key length to 56 bits
is a "smoking gun" which suggests that it was deliberately made just strong
enough to defeat most people while being just weak enough to be crackable by
someone with the right resources (can you say "N-S-A", boys and girls?).
  PGP, on the other hand, uses the IDEA algorithm for conventional encryption;
this uses a 128-bit key and does not have any history which suggests the
possibility of political sabotage.

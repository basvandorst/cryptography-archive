Yes you can.  Just prepend the information in the highest order bits 
of your public key making sure that the number of random low order bits
is sufficient for security. Say, 33 bits for a phone number and an
additional 1000 low order bits for security.

You of course need to make sure the modulus size is sufficient.

Note that you can do the same thing to your *modulus* or 
*secret* key without compromising security whatsoever.
(Although not all at the same time, naturally.)

This is a a good trick if you need to provide closer binding
between any arbitrary data and a RSA key. For example, say
that your service that could be obtained applying your public
key required patrons to be eighteen.  Your public key could
clearly embed: 'By using this public key, I certify that I
am at least eighteen years of age.'

Notice that you can embed any amount or kind of data in this way;
for example, you could embed you public key *into* your modulus
and save quite a bit of space this way in a key directory.

I used this trick several years ago in a 'coupon' method of proving
my identity (so I'd better not see Bellcore try to patent it!  :-))

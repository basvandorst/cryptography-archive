I was told that my last posting had a line length problem, I was told.  Sorry about
that.


I am working on cracking the VideoCipher II Satellite scrambling system.  The video
is, of course, no problem.  The Audeo, however, is encrypted using the DES algorithm.
I am somewhat familiar with the DES Cryptosystem, need some help.  Anyone with extensive knowledge on either the VideoCipher II architecture or the DES system, 
please respond.

							Thanx,
							Jeremy

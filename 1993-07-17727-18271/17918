   I'm wondering if anyone can help me, I'm trying to implement RSA in code,
   and I want to generate secure keys.  I've read some things in papers, but
   they are somewhat ambiguous to me.  One requirement is that gcd(p-1,q-1)
   be small,  also gcd(p-1,e-1) and gcd(q-1,e-1) should be small.  If I'm
   working with a 512 bit modulus (n) what is meant by "small" approximately?
   Another requirement I read is that p and q be "a few digits apart".  Does
   this mean at least a few digits, or no closer than a few?

Small == 2.  I.e., you do not want to have any small factors if at all
possible.  For gcd(p-1,q-1) you are going to have a factor of two,
since both p and q are odd, so p-1 and q-1 are both going to be even.

So, to give an attacker as little help as possible, the gcd should
be 2, 1 if possible!!!

Hope this helps..

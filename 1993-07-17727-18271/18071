Heck, just run PGP in conventional encrypt mode and
encrypt a few gigabytes of anything, including
10 thousand million repetitions of the letter A.
(with compression OFF in this case, of course)

For the pass phrase, just roll a die about fifty times
and enter that: 1351621... whatever .. as the key.

The point is, with a good crypto algorithm you need not worry
about the input stream.  The opponent still needs to know
your key in order to predict the next bit of CBC output
with a chance greater than 50/50 -- even though they might know
the entire input and previous ciphertext with certainty.

A good cipher is supposed to withstand an attacker that
can do a 'chosen plaintext' attack. And assuming that
you will choose the input, they don't even quite have that.

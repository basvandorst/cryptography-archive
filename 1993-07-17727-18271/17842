Both TDMA and CDMA are now official TIA standards.  TDMA is IS-41B,
while CDMA is the recently approved IS-95.

If by "new phones" you meant phones that actually implement digital
(either TDMA or CDMA), I believe this is false. One of the CTIA's
original requirements for digital cell phones is that they also
support analog FM, so customers who travel won't hesitate to buy
digital-capable phones before digital service is universally deployed.
Both of our phones (CD-3000 and CD-7000) are dual mode analog/CDMA.
I've been traveling with a prototype CD-7000; when I'm in San Diego, I
can use our CDMA system, and when I'm elsewhere I can use FM. You can
program the phone to choose CDMA first, analog first, CDMA-only or
FM-only.

You're a little behind. US West and Bell Atlantic have also signed on
with real orders for CDMA. Bell South, NYNEX and Ameritech are still
evaluating both TDMA and CDMA. The only major carriers still
officially "committed" to TDMA are Southwestern Bell and McCaw, and
even McCaw has publicly voiced the sentiment that they'll consider
going CDMA if the rest of the industry goes that way. (See, e.g., the
article in the June 28, 1993 issue of Telephony magazine).

The writing is clearly on the wall.

     There may be no a priori reason, but there is a LOT of case law
in this area, mostly written by the Supreme Court in obscenity cases.
ANY laws restricting the means of expression must both have a lawful
purpose, AND must not have the effect of limiting certain forms of
speech.  For example a law that declared C code to be obscene :-) and
requiring all such speech to be in Pascal would fall to a
demonstration of programs much easier to express in C than Pascal.

      A law restricting the communication of executable images, on the
other hand, might be acceptable because there is no evidence that
people normally communicate through core dumps.  (Of course, ten years
ago such a law would have failed.)

Don't hold your breath. I could cite many reasons why a high power,
costly, large packaged, 5 volt, sole-sourced hardware encryption chip
with highly uncertain supply and delivery schedules (like Clipper) is
wholly unacceptable in a compact, price-competitive, battery-operated
consumer product like a hand-held cell phone. But I won't.

Correction:
 
I left out one critical portion to my previous post (silly me).
 
The Stackered problem can be overcome by inserting the
TMP=C:\DIRECTORY (where DIRECTORY can be any directory or even root,
if you prefer) in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file or by inserting TMP = "C:\"
in the PGP CONFIG.TXT file. Of course, this only holds true if
a.) the C: partition is un-Stackered, and b.) the C: partition has
enough free space to accomodate the PGP work space.
 
Try it.

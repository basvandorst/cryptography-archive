Unfortunately it appears that you cannot do this.

``Public domain'' for the ITAR is not the same as ``public domain'' for
the copyright law.

The author of a work can unilaterally place it into the ``public
domain'' for copyright purposes. All he has to do is waive his exclusive 
copyright.

But it seems that the author of a work cannot place it into the ``public
domain'' for export purposes. A work cannot be ``public domain'' under
the ITAR unless it is published. It appears to be the position of DTC,
the agency which administers ITAR, that ITAR prohibits the act of
publishing the work in the first place.

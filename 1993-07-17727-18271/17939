Does anyone know of patents or implementations of Signatured FAX machines ?

I am thinking particularly of systems using Public Key Cryptography 
Signatures or Authentication.

My interest comes from the Signatured / Encrypted FAX system which I have 
developed.  I am about to apply for world wide patents, but there is no 
point in spending all that money if someone else has already done it.

Please post any replies to this news group or  directly mail them to

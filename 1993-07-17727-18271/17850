Methinks you mean "asymmetric."

RIPEM uses the cryptographic routines in a library called RSAREF,
which is a product of RSADSI and isn't public domain (though it is
freely available within the constraints that U.S. export law permits
and comes with a license allowing noncommercial use.)  RIPEM is in the
public domain (though it's not very useful without an implementation
of some library compilant with the published RSAREF interface.)  This
is because using RSAREF is currently the only way to utilize the RSA
algorithm in the U.S. without cost and without violating patents.

RSADSI is not the maker of RIPEM.  They make RSAREF.  RIPEM was
written by Mark Riordan, who is not part of with PKP/RSADSI (indeed,
he has been threatened by them with legal action in the past.)

As to whether it's a good idea to use PGP in the U.S., suffice it to
say there's a variety of opinions on the issue (the RIPEM FAQ lists a
few.)  It's been done to death countless times, though, and doesn't
belong in sci.crypt.  With luck it'll become a non-issue in time.

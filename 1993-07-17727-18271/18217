Mike,

That's an interesting point as to whether the technique used in "The Nine
Tailors" is pure steganography or a mixture of steganography and
cryptography. The  algorithm is as follows:

The message consists of a sequence of letters. Ideally, the message appears
to be normal English-language text. The key is a sequence of integers,
periodically repeated. If the first integer in the key is N, then the first
letter of plaintext is the Nth letter of the message. After that, the next
letter of plaintext is selected by advancing in the message a number of
letters equal to the next integer in the key.

Since the algorithm does not use substitution or transposition, but rather is
position-based, I am not sure that this is a cryptographic technique. It is
definitely a steganographic technique. My point was that knowing the
algorithm is a steganographic technique does not automatically render it
worthless. If there is an associated key, then recovering the plaintext
without the key is nontrivial.

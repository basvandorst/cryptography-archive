One interesting development with recent OS's is the advent of shared
libraries.  Surffice it to say, it is quite trivial to change crypt()
to whatever algorithm you like and modify getpass() so that passwords
longer that 8 characters are returned (well it is under sunOS anyway :-).

If you want to use MD5, you can,
since any program that ever called crypt() all call the new version in the
shared library.  You may have problems with programs that expect
to get back 13 characters from crypt().

I expect that :

 1.  Major corporations which deal with government regulation would bne reluctant to
     test the waters with a truely secure phone.  Romor has it that AT&T internally
     develpoed a secure phone yhears ago, but didn't market it for fear of provoking
     regulatory action against it's deployment.

 2.  Private investors are going to be reluctant to fund development of truely 
     secure communications products unless a federal law or supreme court decision
     clarifies the public's right to secure encryption.

     In fact, the investment solicitation for capital for a "secure communications 
     product" would almost certainly (because of the obligation to disclose risk
     factors known to the principals to avoid being sued later) list "possible
     government regulation of cryptography" as a risk.

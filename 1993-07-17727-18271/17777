Unless I misunderstand, there seem to be a series of non sequiturs:

But, AFAIK, the patent does not hold in Europe and therefor this comment 
seems invalid. That US law is not the same as European (which?) law is surely
a matter of difference rather than flaw?

Are you sure? Are you confusing ITAR and the COCOM agreement?  If you do mean
COCOM, can you say how this affects importation of crypto from Europe into 
the US? Even with regard to ITAR, a permanent importation should cause no 
difficulty.

Taking "bongoed" to mean weakened, doesn't the strength required bear some 
relationship the use proposed? 


IMO, though relevant to cryptology, most readers of this group seem 
(temorarily or teminally?) fatigued by these aspects. Suggest follow-up 
to e-mail.

I doubt we would publish that sort of stuff, but it probably won't
matter. If the kind of stuff I saw demonstrated at the Hackers'
Convention last fall is any indication, certain people would actually
take the lack of documentation as a serious challenge...

Chances are it would be technically illegal (an FCC rules violation)
to load "unapproved" software into a cell phone on the basis that it
violates the phone's original FCC type certification.  This is not as
ridiculous as it sounds because it *is* possible to write software
that would cause any cell phone (not just ours) to operate out of spec
and cause undue interference to other users. There's a direct analogy
here to those after-market ROMs you can put in certain cars'
computer-controlled ignition systems to boost performance at the
expense of greater emissions. In other words, there *is* a kernel of a
valid government interest here, even if the rules they write to deal
with it are far too broad.

If you piss them off enough, the government might well decide to go
after you anyway on a "technical" violation even if your modifications
are completely "clean".  This kind of thing *has* been known to happen
before, yes, even in the USA...I could tell you some good stories about
certain rather selective FCC field enforcement actions...

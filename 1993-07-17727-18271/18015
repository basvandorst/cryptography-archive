What does "digital cellular" offer in regard to safeguards against
stealing your phone's ID number? (Each phone has a Mobile Identification
Number and an Electronic Serial Number that, combined, are used for billing.)
These numbers are broadcast in the clear and can be picked up by scanners.

In publications such as "Nuts and Volts" there are blatent ads for
equipment that allows a semi-technical person to reprogram a cellphone to
someone else's MIN/ESN. Free call to wherever....

It seems the current system is a sitting duck for this kind of theft of
service. Is there a fix in Verson 2?

I am unsure if this is the right place to post, but I working with a medium
sized database -- around 5 meg -- and I am concerned about using up this much
space on my users hard drives when they install our reader and database. I
would therefore like to find source code for compressing and decompressing
the data on the fly -- one line at a time.

I am coding in Turbo C++ for MS-DOS but C code would be fine. If anyone can
suggest a site where I can ftp code from or some books which might contain
the needed algorithms and suggestions about implementation I would be
grateful.

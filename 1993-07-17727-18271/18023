Have you not been reading the thread up to this point?  Is this the only
message that you have read?  Up until that post, the argument had been very
one sided against DS and he was replying with false arguments. 

The messages posted by DS in this thread have consisted of indirection from
the points that have been made against him.  I can see how one would fall
for these arguments and think that DS is making logical refutations to his
opponents points, but that just isn't so.  Look again more closely and try
not to be so quick to judge next time.

Hurah for BIX.  Enjoy it, but don't compare it to usenet, there is none to 
be had.  BTW, this post is meant to be LIGHT.  Take it such.

Let me return the favor by helping Lulu out. There's a distinction called
general and specific. There's plenty of general precedent (i.e. court
decisions) about the validity of patents when issued. Thus the precedent
that applies to the instant case is the general set.

The tired argument that it will take a court decision to "confirm" the
validity of the PKP patents has been around in various .net crypto groups
for at least a year to my direct knowledge, and has been refuted for as long
by various writers here. Perhaps Lulu would like to move on to more useful
pursuits, such as helping to code a RSAREF-compliant U.S. version of PGP.

Too much chin music, not enough coding from the U.S. PGP fans.

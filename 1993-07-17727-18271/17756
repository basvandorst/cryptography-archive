Has anyone given thought to the idea of allowing some "slop" in the crypt  
- decrypt process?  What I mean is, for some kinds of text, who cares if 1  
in 20 or 30 characters is wrong in the decrypted version?  Obviously this  
method would be bad for binaries, source code, etc, but it would be fine  
for text of the form "Dear Dirary, guess what I did today...".  

Just a thought....

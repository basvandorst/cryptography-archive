A week or so ago someone responsed to a posting of
mine concerning the structure of the IP in DES.  You
referred to the possibility of it being a hardware-related
decision.  I am currently writing a paper on DES, and
would appreciate it if you could e-mail me the information.
As long as I am including the 'sinister' possibilities, I
should balance it with the 'practical' side too.  Please
indicate if and how you would like to be credited for the
info in the Biblio.  Thanks in advance.

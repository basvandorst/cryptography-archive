You're off by an order of magnitude. It was called : "One Million Random
Digits" and was pubvlished by that notorious subversive organzation, Rand Corp.
Back in the 60s, when desktops were nonexistant and CPU time was precious,
no one had ready access to random number generators, the bopok was indispensi-
ble to any sort of statistical work. Can anyone today imagine doing a Monte 
Carlo simulation by hand?

At any rate possession of it certainly wasn't illegal. And it wouldn't have
made a very satisfactory one-time pad since a million digits isn't all
that many when it's the only source of random numbers that most anyone had.

Quite correct.  I take it that the original questioner, and everyone
else but DS in this thread, was interested in *specific* precedent.
By asking a question about "whether precedent had been set re. PKP's
patents covering PGP", the only real sensible reading is as *specific
precedents*.... It's seems a bit contorted to assume that the
questioner hadn't known whether there had ever been court cases in the
US governing the general principle of patents.  But that's what one
does by reading the question in the sense of *general precedent*.  But
DS is quite correct here to point out this distinction, which should
be kept in mind by posters interested in PKP, or other, cryptography
patents.

I won't comment on the general circulation of the "tired argument" DS
mentions.  I suspect he (they) has misread many posts as making this
argument.  At any rate, *I* was quite explicit in disclaiming this
argument in all germane posts.

Yours, Lulu...

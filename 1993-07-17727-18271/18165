It sure would be useful to have an optional front end
that would use the FIPS hash to crunch a pass phrase down
to be input to the PASSWD routine.  The next step would be
to rewrite the PASSWD routine to actually make use of
more of those bits through 'almost' triple DES encryption:
3 * 56 = 168 bits while the SHS produces only 160 bits.

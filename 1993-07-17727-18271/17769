   Hmmm.  The rubber hose is illegal, but threatening to charge you with
some outrageous number or nasty felonies, so that even a single conviction
will leave you imprisoned for many years, is quite legal.  For some
alleged crimes, everything you own can be taken from you, and you will have
to fight in court to get it back.
 
   Presumably, this will be used commonly (as encryption becomes more
common) to get one person to give evidence against another.  This is a
good reason for thinking about methods of encryption that require multiple
anonymous parties to retrieve information.

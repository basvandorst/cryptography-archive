Though you may be right, I'm relying on a statement in one of the releases
that the Clipper chip will cost $25. With reasonable overheads that should
put the street price of the phone up by under $100 compared to a vanilla
version. I assume the new digitals will initially sell in the $800-$1200
range, just as the AMPS phones originally did.

But as I said, it's speculation on my part, not "the truth".

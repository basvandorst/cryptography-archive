My company has a very heterogenous environment : IBM/MVS, PC/Windows-Netware,
VAX/VMS, */U*ix. Users need access to systems within several environments 
and on different systems within the same environment.
For each system they need to remember a username and password, which must be 
changed regularly, due to the local security rules.
The situation is even more complex as several applications require also an 
authentication (e.g. Oracle). We would like to setup a kind of "global" login,
 where a user logs in to the Network, and then gets access to systems and 
applications on systems, each with different authorizations.
I am looking (rather urgent) for 
a) an overview of platform specific solutions and what their weak points 
are : e.g. NIS on Unix, clustering on VMS, ... for PC-Lans
b) do there exist other available techniques (Kerberos, RSA, ...), are they 
suited for what we want, and what implementations become available in the 
(near) future

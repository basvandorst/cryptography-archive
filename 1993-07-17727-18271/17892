Let's just talk about the core algorithms, DES and IDEA.  I'll assume
that the implementation, key management, etc, are secure and
concentrate on attacks against DES or IDEA.

Firstly, both DES and IDEA were specifically designed to defeat
differential cryptanalysis.  How differential cryptanalysis works is
not relevant; suffice it to say that it's the most powerful attack
known on this type of product cipher.

Exhaustive (or brute force) attack on a ciper involves testing every
possible key against a plaintext/ciphertext pair.  Such an attack
requires great computational resources, such as those at the NSA.
This is possible with DES, which has only 56 key bits, but not with
IDEA, which has 128 key bits.

There is a differential attack on DES which slightly reduces the
effort below that of exhaustive attack.  I know of no such attack on
IDEA.  I know of no attack on IDEA which is better than exhaustive
search.

Three iterations of DES can be combined to give an effective doubling
of key length.

After much initial speculation, it now appears that the DES was
designed to be as strong as possible against attacks not known to the
public at the time it was published.  There is no longer any
justification for the assertion, sometimes seen here, that DES was
designed to be easily breakable.

DES has withstood attacks by many of the world's best cryptanalysts
for many years.  People are working on IDEA, but it hasn't has the
same amount of exposure.

Please don't repeat such rumours if you don't have a source.

Andrew.

P.S.  Is this in the FAQ?

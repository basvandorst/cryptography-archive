     Look! Look! He admits it! He's not only trying to destroy any
attempts to bring secure communication into the hands of the great
unwashed masses, but he's also trying to destroy our internet!
Of what other dastardly deeds might he be the mastermind? Will we ever
know the full scope of the conspiracies he is controlling? Answers
to these questions (and more) can be had by sending *me* your money.

(But seriously -- As much as I disagree with the opinions David has
expressed in sci.crypt, I have never seen him resort to namecalling
or other such childish behaviour that I have observed in many
groups -- by many other people. David, please continue to post here --
if nothing else, it would be boring if you were to stop.)

Regards,
Ian.

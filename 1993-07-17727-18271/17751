And this is the real tragedy. Except for the RF interference issue,
every reason the government might have a legitimate interest in what
you do to your own cell phone's software would immediately vanish if
they had been properly designed with *real* (cryptographically
enforced) security and privacy in the first place.  It wouldn't matter
*what* you did to your own phone; without the right crypto keys, it
would simply be impossible to make a fraudulent call or listen on
other people's conversations.

This is what I find so neat about cryptography. It has the potential
to enforce certain societal rules most of us agree are good (thou
shalt not listen to thy neighbor's or political opponent's phone
calls, thou shalt not commit toll or credit card fraud, nor
counterfeit money, etc) without the need for an ever-expanding law
enforcement "community", with all of the attendant risks. The
Cypherpunks call this "crypto anarchy", but that word "anarchy"
bothers me. I'd call it "cryptocracy", or something like that. One
does not need cops to enforce the laws of mathematics; they enforce
themselves very nicely.

Yes, there is, actually.

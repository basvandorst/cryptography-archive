Rubbish. You can very simply use erase and kill
characters -- they just need to be escaped with a
backslash. I'm pleased to know that I'll be safer
now if I use them in my passwords. If you want to
use a backslash reliably, you should escape it
too (by doubling it). I don't see why you
shouldn't use the bell, since it won't be echoed
any more than any other character; just make sure
you wait for the prompt, which you should do
anyway. And 'break' isn't a character, it is a
signal delivering line condition which some
versions of Unix will eventually stuff into the
input buffer as a special sequence. Lastly, you
omitted the signal delivering characters (often
control-C and control-\) and the two end of file
characters (control-D and null as it happens, by
default).

And we didn't need to make a distinction between
120 and 128 to do that -- especially since many
international Unix system keyboards are quite capable of
generating another hundred or so characters
besides these. There is no special reason why you
can't have high-bit-set characters in your
password.

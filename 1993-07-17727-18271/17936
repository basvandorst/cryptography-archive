   First, I have read the FAQ, and if the answers to what I am asking
   are in there, they went so far over my head that not only didn't 
   I understand them, I didn't realize I was looking at them.

   I have a few basic questions.

   The first has to do with compression.

   From what I have been reading, one of the big things that is
   used to break an encryption system is to look for frequency of
   certain characters or words. Now, my question is does compression
   compleatly kill the ability of an attacker to use statistical 
   attack methods ? Why or Why not ?

   I saw in the FAQ the following suggesting a triple DES setup
 
   E(K1, Tran( E(K2, Tran( E(K3, Compress( x ))))))

   Some compression programs add a standard header, how badly does
   this hurt the security of DES or other systems ? why ?
   I was wondering if haveing known plantext at the begining of
   the file is more usefull then know plantext at the end in systems
   that have feedback ?

   My last question is how do S-boxes work ?
   I haven't seen an explanation I can understand. 
   I would like a slow, step my step explanation of how they work.


   Thanks for any help you can provide

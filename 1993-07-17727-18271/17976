There seems to be some misunderstanding about the DSA. The security DSA with 
a 160 bit subgroup of a 512 bit prime field (resulting in a 320 bit 
signature) is roughly comparable to that of 512 bit RSA (if not slightly 
better). 160/1024 bit DSA is roughly comparable to 1024 bit RSA.

Disclaimer: As always such comparisons are nothing more than handwaving and 
subject to change with the next major break-through in computational number 
theory.

There are two ways to attack the DSA by means of computing the discrete log:
(i) Using the prime field: The best-known asymptotic complexity for doing 
this is roughly comparable (see disclaimer above) to factoring and thus the 
bitsize of the field has to be about as long as an RSA modulus. *However* 
this has nothing to do with the length of the signature.
(ii) Using the subgroup directly: The best-known algorithm for this has 
complexity O(sqrt(order of the group)). The size of signature is twice the 
logaritmh of the order of the subgroup .

So why not start with a modified DSA using MD5 instead of SHA and a 128 bit 
subgroup of a 1024 bit prime field? The result should be a 256 bit signature 
which is still a lot more secure than 384 bit RSA.

I have other ideas to further reduce the size of the signature without 
reducing the security more than marginally, which I am just trying to write 
up.

You asked for it - you got it :-)

Heute muss das Paper werden. Frisch, Zitate, seid zur Hand!

(Man merkt: Mir gehen schon langsam die Klassiker-Zitate aus ...)

There are perfectly usable 'noise diodes' available from your local
electronics supermarket. If you cannot get the special 'noise' types, a
normal zenner diode can be used as a noise source. A simple amplifier 
circuit using an op amp and a comparitor and a divide by to stage and you
have a good noise source. The divide by 2 stage after the comparitor ensures
equal probability of 0's and 1's. When you want  random bit you sample
the output from the divide by 2 stage. As long as you don't sample too fast
you will get a random sequence of 1's and 0's based on quantum effects.

My vote is for the latter.  They say that the best solution to bad
law is stringent enforcement, and this is certainly a good example.
For years, irresponsible computer manufactures have been exporting 
dangerous encryption routines, telling the public that they
are just "random number generators".  Well, enough is enough, and it's
time that these companies were held accountable for their actions!!
The law stipulates that they must clear those routines with the State
department, so they damn well better do it!! (Sarcasm off)

It seems to me that the export laws are begging to be taken to
court.  Maybe they made sense fourty years ago when digital computers
didn't exist, and cyptographic materials consisted of big
clunky single purpose machines.  Today, however, they are a 
dinosaur.  Do I violate the law if I take a list of random
numbers out of the country without approval?  Why is
DES in CFB mode not just an error detection algorithm?  I
suppose that I will treat this law like I treat the thousands
of other stupid laws we have: ignore it.

Not in my copy... :-)

I've got FIPS PUB 46 sitting here in front of me, and the
paragraph of the section entitled "Explanation" states "The
key consists of 64 binary digies ("0"s or "1"s) of which 56
bits are used directly by the algorithm and 8 bits are used for
error detection"  It then goes on to say that "each of the 56
bits used directly by the algorithm are random and the 8 error
detecting bits are set to make the parity of each 8-bit byte
of the key odd..."

Are you sure you have the real FIPS PUB 46 -- I found the
document tolerably well-written, and had no trouble at all
implementing it.

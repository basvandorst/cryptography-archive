According to a fourth year project on secure telephone links here at the
University, there's another method of voice compression that's
computationally much cheaper than linear prediction and sounds better
too.  It doesn't compress nearly as well, but it's well within the range
a high speed modem can manage.  It's called Adaptive Differential Pulse
Code Modulation and it seems fairly simple.  I can look for more details
if anyone wants.

Unfortunately the crypto knowledge of the guy who did the project wasn't
too strong, but the rest of it sounds interesting.

Do any widespread PC sound cards have sampling and playback?  Would a
nice, friendly PC software package that uses readily-available hardware
to provide secure voice links be a useful stopgap solution?  Is it
computationally feasable?

I know it's a fallacy to think that compression removes the need for
strong crypto, but it would be nice to hope that it would complicate
cryptanalysis enough that you could use a cypher weak enough to be
implemented in software.  Something like a simple block chained product
cypher with fewer rounds than usual...

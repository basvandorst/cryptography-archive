I need any available technical info on the Clipper chip. I believe 
was kind enough recently to post some info, but I just caught the
tail-end of some of the discussions about it.

Also any details about Skipjack and the follow-on chip Capstone(?) would
also be appreciated.

Also, I understand a "blue-ribbon" panel is being allowed to review the
underlying algorithm(s). Any additional info on this (e.g., names) 
would also be appreciated.

TIA,

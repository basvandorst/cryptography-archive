Hi guys..

I am a computer science student at Otago University in New Zealand, and I was
wondering if anyone could tell me where I can get an algorithm for the RSA
public-key system, including the algorithms for manipulation of long integers.

Please ignore the ZOOLOGY@otago.ac.nz address, it is a communal usercode for
the zoology department.  Please send any replies to
COSC277@rivendell.otago.ac.nz.


Thanks in anticipation

Richard Stevenson

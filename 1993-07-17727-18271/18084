In conjuction with the United Mine Workers of America strike, at least
one of the coal companies currently has over a dozen of the AT&T
Telephone Security Device Model 3600.

It comes in a green-ish turquise box. Six of them just arrived today.
I don't know if any special strings were pulled to obtain them.

Some of the "devices" are installed in a briefcase along with the guts
of a cellular phone, so that secure calls can be made from the field.
There is about a quater-/half- second delay in the voice, which is
initially quite confusing when one tests a pair of the phones in the
same room.

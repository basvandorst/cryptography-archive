I agree with the philosophy- you do not want to have to rely on ld.so,
etc on single user boot up. However it means that you cannot make root
secure by altering your crypt.
Actually, one idea is to seed your new crypt with the userid as the
initial string that crypt acts on, instead of strting with 0. That way
root still uses the old crypt, while everyone else uses a new on- It
means that each password must be cracked seperately- especially on large
systems, you don;t get the savings that redundant seeds give you in
cracking.Since you want root to be best protected it is still ironic
that that that little init messes up the game. Is the Sun init a
standard BSD init or is it special?

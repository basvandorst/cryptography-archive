Right, AT&T has a stellar track record in this regard, having set
de-facto standards like the PC7300, the 3B, System V and Datakit.
Not to mention Picturephone...

Okay, so maybe that was a cheap shot (a most satisfying one, I'll
admit). But you have to admit that there are two ways to stay in
business: produce innovative, competitive products quickly, or have
very deep pockets fed by a cash cow.

For 13 years I worked for companies in the latter category. I now work
for the former type. It's a totally different world, believe me. In
our case, tying the future of our product to Clipper would be
equivalent to tying our entire company's future to it. Unacceptable.

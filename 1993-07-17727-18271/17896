See, the thing about a one-time pad is, only two people would have it.
The sender and the receiver.  If the host program is a receiver, then your
problem is making the receiver impregnable.  This isn't as hard as it sounds.

Make your player the sender and receiver.  Each player gets a disk with his/
her information on it, plus the one-time pad key.  The host program will
read player information that is decoded, only.  The player goes about the
game, and stats are saved for next game play on the player's disk.  The host
program will only save as much information as is needed to facilitate the
other players.

In other words, all encryption-decryption should be done on the player's end, 
not the host program's.  Unless you can put the host program in a remote
location and make it a dialup, whereupon you can hide as much as you like,
you're kinda stuck.

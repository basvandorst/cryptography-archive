   Actually minutes for any password.  Someone generated a complete reverse
   dictionary for the standard Unix password system, its less than a gigabyte.

That's rather hard to believe. Assuming 64 possible choices for each
character of the password, all 8-char passwords (a subset of all
possible passwords) gives 2.8E14 different passwords according to dc.
Assuming 25 bytes for each password gives a file size of 7E15 bytes.
This is on the order of a million gigs. Even gzip won't help you too
much here. At one password per microsecond that's 8 years of cpu time
to generate the file. Sorry, friend, it doesn't wash.

I'm sure this must have come up before, but I can't find mention of it in the FAQ. 
I don't read this newsgroup regularly, I just came here looking for information
on this one subject, so I apologize if this has already been hashed out (no
pun intended).

I just read in PCWeek that Telebit has a product for remote LAN nodes that
uses a new MIT-developed security method called KERBEROS.  The article 
claims it is an 'emerging encryption standard.'

I was wondering what this was, and how it worked.

Thanks,
Scott

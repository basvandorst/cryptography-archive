128^^5 = 3.4359738 E 10
(5 chars with each 128 possible values)
divide by 365 = 94,136,269.51 per day
divide by 24  = 3,922,344.563 per hour
divide by 60 = 65,372.40938  per minute
divide by 60 = 1,089.54 crypts per sec

I have a fast crypt on my personal iris that does 1108 crypts/sec
(R3000A 20 MHz, 64K/32K cache, 16 MBytes, 16 MIPS)

I'm not surprised his 3100 can do the same.

Actually, it would be statistically half the time.

When someone specified a 4 char password a few years ago ("giap") the
time it took was 21 minutes.  (started with lower case, didn't I?)
Instead of 2.8 days.

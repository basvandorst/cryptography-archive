A commercial enterprise places Clipper devices on each end of one of its
private trunks. Many people in the organization share this trunk. Indeed many
people in the organization share many trunks. Now the government expects that
Vice-President X is engaged in some nefarious activity with President Y.

What does law enforcement do now. Do they require that the carrier route all
of the enterprise's traffic to the Clipper decoding box? How on earth would they
extract the calls from VP X's telephone from all others? How would law 
enforcement be able to decipher the networking protocol for routing
and synchronize to the voice compression scheme? How on earth would the
Clipper box keep up with multiple DS3 traffic?

Even if they were able to do this, how could they stop VP X from making his
criminal calls from the telephones conviently provided in meeting rooms?

Indeed why was Clipper created? It has major problems with commercial traffic?
It is far to expensive for private traffic. I suspect that it was a calulated
political decision to outlaw cryptography - not by law but but fiat by
creating regulations that make crytography impossible.

I agree.  How viable would be just a CRC of a secret key?  It would be very
easy to implement.  Would this be sufficient if the key was well chosen?  Maybe
write a crc that forms 16 byte output?

I'm new to the subject of cryptography, but I've been trying to do my homework
to get up to speed.  Earlier this year I got the urge to rewrite DEC's 
password hashing algorithm from VAX MACRO into somewhat portable C.  I have
ported the algorithms (4 supported) to DEC Alpha, Sun SPARC, and Silicon
Graphics workstations.  I'm sure that the use of this code in any kind of
commercial software is a violation of DEC's copyright (even though the
algorithm was discussed in detail in the Communcations of the ACM, Aug. 1974),
but it may be useful as a non-DES, non-commercial, non-pervasive hashing
method.

If you know anything about the security of this algorithm, or could point me
towards essential reading material dealing with cryptography in general, I
would greatly appreciate it.


Cheers!

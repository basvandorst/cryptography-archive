Lulu argues that a specific precedent is needed before we know the PKP
patents are valid.

This is uh, er, quite inconsistent with all the law we have. You don't need
a specific precedent to see if someone driving over 55 in a 30 mile zone is
speeding. It's prima facie, both implicitly, and in many states explicitly.

I fear Lulu is confusing the trial of an individual offense with the
definition of offenses.

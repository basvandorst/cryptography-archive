I seem to have some problems in getting to the stuff in the anon ftp site
rsa.com in the directory rsaref/dist. There are no read permissions for
others so I cant see what to get. The README file says :

then change to the following directory:

dist/U.S.-only-5a3631  

but I cannot seem to get into that directory. 

Could someone throw some light on this..

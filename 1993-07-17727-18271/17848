What about conferences?  There are crypto conferences in which 
technical material is discussed --- even talking about cryptanalysis
of DES, which involves some technical details about DES.  Since the
material is disclosed to an audience made up of US and non-US citizens
alike, it would seem like this is export of cryptographic information.

In fact, this seems fairly close to the situation with ftp --- you're
disclosing something that can be seen/obtained by both US and non-US
sources.

So the $64k question is: does the government try to control what its
scientists can discuss at a conference (I remember stories where some
control was attempted in the past, but I haven't heard anything like
this for some time).

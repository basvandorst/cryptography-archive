I'm wondering if anyone can help me, I'm trying to implement RSA in code,
and I want to generate secure keys.  I've read some things in papers, but
they are somewhat ambiguous to me.  One requirement is that gcd(p-1,q-1)
be small,  also gcd(p-1,e-1) and gcd(q-1,e-1) should be small.  If I'm
working with a 512 bit modulus (n) what is meant by "small" approximately?
Another requirement I read is that p and q be "a few digits apart".  Does
this mean at least a few digits, or no closer than a few?

If you have some insight in this are, please send me some mail.  Thanks.

Regardless of what the artistic/creative value of the original document
is, using it as a part of a protocol might not be considered equivalent
of (re)_publishing_ it.  Perhaps the author of the "cracker" program
has encrypted the document so that the user of the program never gets
to see the cleartext.  I can't see how this could infringe any law about
publishing anything.

And even if all clones were declared illegal - who would want to buy a
product that was guaranteed _not_ to have a second source, ever?
Usually buyers want second sources, or at least options for them.

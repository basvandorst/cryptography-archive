You were getting less than full disclosure. "x-ready" doesn't mean it works
using x, but just that it continues to work when x is around. In the
particular case, the phones will continue to work when cellular services cut
over to digital because they will continue to devote a certain number of
channels to supporting analog (AMPS or N-AMPS). But your old phone will
still operate analogue, with the same eavesdropping weakness. To get the
somewhat higher security of digital (vanilla scanners won't work, even if
they receive cellular frequencies) you have to buy a new phone.

Few new phones are dual-mode to allow roaming in analog areas. So far the
only hand-held I've seen is a European model--Blaupunkt, I think. Hughes
will have car models in a few months, as will several other vendors, and
maybe hand-helds as well. So will Motorola, but right now there's no digital
Motorola hand-held available.

Further complicating matters is that there's still a fight  between TDMA and
CDMA, and at least one carrier, PacTel Cellular, still says it's going CDMA.

I've not heard of triple-mode phones, so this can be hard on customers.

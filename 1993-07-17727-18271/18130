     Use numbered ballots for the next election.  The ballot-server
will have a record of the ballot number which should match the ballot
number of the vote, and (if you add it to the vote ack) the vote
receipt.  No cryptrography needed.  No key problems, ballot-server
"authenticates" valid claims, no export limitations.  :-)

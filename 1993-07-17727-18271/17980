How can it possibly be that DS has not even the barest ability to
*read*.  Beyond disclaiming the statement above in each and every of
the posts I've written in this thread, I just don't know how to make
this clear to DS.  I suspect that DS is just so committed to
obfuscation, that he/they/it (?) just doesn't give a damn what I or
anyone else *writes* -- because it might interfere with the generation
of pro-PKP/pro-NSA flak.

Yours, Lulu...

They actually did a reasonable (though not particularly elegant) job
on this one.  The IS-41B standard calls for the signing of various
important messages by one-way function hashing. Essentially you append
a secret key to the message, run it through a one-way hash, and
transmit that over the air.  The base does the same computation and
compares results. If the one-way hash is a good one, no one can
generate the correct hash value without the key, or by trying all
possible hash codes.

There's a time-dependent field in the hash input, which guards against
replay attacks.

The one-way hash function is *not* MD-4, MD-5, SNEFRU or anything like
that. It's an unpublished algorithm from Motorola. It is claimed that
it cannot be published because of "ITAR restrictions". In other words,
misinformation about export controls runs rampant even outside USENET.

The scheme could have been much more elegant had public key
cryptography been used. But they opted for a secret key scheme, which
greatly complicates things since it requires a real-time network
between a serving system and a home system to authenticate a roamer.
The network lets the home system generate a temporary key for use by
the serving system and the roaming user; the user's permanent key
never leaves the home system.

At the end of your tirade you might consider that OTPs are still quite
useful for many purposes.  If I choose to use a OTP to communicate with
each of my corporate sites I can visit them once a year with sufficient
material to handle the entire year's communication, both text and
speech. The encryption/decryption process is quite fast.  It is no more
error prone than any other data transmission, which means that this is
not typically a factor.  "Start-up" speed of transitioning to a OTP
system incorporates a delay, but after that speed is not a factor.
Security of the material remains an issue, but not an insurmountable
one by any means.

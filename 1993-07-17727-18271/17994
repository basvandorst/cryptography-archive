   Thank you.  Is this written up in detail anywhere accessible, or is 
   it planned to be?  I'd like to pore over it more carefully.

You can find out more detail from VLSI Technology's product bulletins.
If you call up and ask "Tell me everything about your new chip for the NSA",
some people have had them react badly, though they were helpful to me.
What you need to ask for are their product bulletins on
	512x1 and 512x32 vROM Programmable Blocks
	pFSB Library Elements
	pFSB Library Support Cells
which tell you about their ViaLink Antifuse Technology and asssociated
tamperproofing; you might also ask for any other info on ViaLink.
They've also got a short form catalog that's got 50-100 pages of info
on their ASICs, standard chips, etc.

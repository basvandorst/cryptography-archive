Please note also that you have to feed the 2**47 plaintexts into your
opponent's crypto system and have to make him return the ciphertexts to
you.  This may not be easy in cases like VTAM SLE (Session Level
Encryption) where a randon session key is chosen for each session
that is bound (the next session between the same LUs will have a
different key).

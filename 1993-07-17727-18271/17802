   Maybe not. AT&T advertised it for sale a few weeks ago in the Wall Street
   Journal.  Even though the escrow agencies aren't yet set up, if someone wants
   to buy it on trust, all the anti-Clipperies in the world won't stop them.

Sure, and we at Pure Fiction Hardware are planning to put out the
Rot13-Phone (tm pending) soon, too.  Trust us!

Well-designed Clipperphones are quite effective until somebody gives
away the Secret Escrow Keys or changes the rules, 
assuming of course that the production volume will be adequate and you
can get pre-wiretapped\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b\b-escrowed chips on schedule.

The Rot13-Phone, like Clipperphones, will keep out amateur eavesdroppers
like your local police, doesn't depend on government hardware,
doesn't have to wait for the escrow agencies to be set up,
doesn't lose all its security when some government bureaucrat decides
key escrow is too expensive and puts the keys in the FBI Library,
and in short will work just fine unless one of our developers
is bribed into giving away the key.  (Send bribery offers to the address below;
digicash or money orders accepted :-)  A special Rot-47 model will be
available for Japanese use as well.

I'm not going to bash AT&T or Motorola or anybody else who's building
a Clipperphone (I've done that enough:-); as a stockholder I do hope they
make some money on it or at least use the expertise the develop to
start selling inexpensive higher-security phones to the public, and
maybe this will start waking up businesses to the value of protecting
their conversations and build a market for real security products.  

On the other hand, besides the issues that have been retread on these
lists, there are some other negatives - it'll probably take the Feds
6-12 months to figure out procedures and organization for actually
wiretapping any Clipperphones, which means that quick-thinking Mafiosi
could use them for 6 months, and slower-thinking criminals could use
them occasionally until wiretapping becomes more widespread.  
And, export laws or not, they *will* be exported, and at least used
for secure conversations between overseas locations, if not for
US-to-foreign calls where the NSA's more likely to be wiretapping.

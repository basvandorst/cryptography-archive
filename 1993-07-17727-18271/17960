DES does not use random salts.

The ``salt'' in the UNIX password hash is consists of permuting elements
of the E-box.  Briefly, if bit i of the salt is set, E-box elements i
and i+24 are swapped.  A 0 salt thus reduces to straight DES.

While changing the E-box would cause trouble for dedicated DES
crackers, as a general matter it seems to weaken DES somewhat.  The
E-box is tailored to match the P permutation and the S-boxes, and I
think the key schedule generation algorithm; variants don't have as
good avalanche properties.  (I.e., a change in a single key bit takes
longer to affect the same number of plaintext bits).  (See the
discussion of Hamiltonian cycles in DES in Davies and Price's
``Security for Computer Networks''.)

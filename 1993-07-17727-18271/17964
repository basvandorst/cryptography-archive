   While changing the E-box would cause trouble for dedicated DES
   crackers, as a general matter it seems to weaken DES somewhat.  
   The E-box is tailored to match the P permutation and the S-boxes, 
   and I think the key schedule generation algorithm; variants don't 
   have as good avalanche properties.  (I.e., a change in a single 
   key bit takes longer to affect the same number of plaintext bits). 

It probably would have made sense to use some salted DES iterations
and some unsalted ones.  If I were redesigning the Unix password crypt()
today I suppose I'd probably use MD5 instead of DES, with 30-60 bits
worth of salt and arbitrarily long passwords.  

Of course, that ignores the far more important issue of designing a
system that can work across networks as well as locally; 
public-key approaches could be used at the expense of patents,
longer passwords and storing a passphrase-encrypted private key somewhere.

Has anybody done a Diffie-Hellman based approach?  I've tried a few
things which keep either getting snagged on man-in-the-middle attacks,
or requiring a secret key known by the host, neither of which is adequate.

I'm not clear on whether Cliff Sharp means 'any compulsory key escrow
system' or 'any key escrow system'. If the first, few could disagree.
Clipper is voluntary. What's more, the government has now said they have no
plans to oulaw non-Clipper crypto.

But if Cliff means "any" then this reminds me of the right-to-lifers
position, which is not against abortion for themselves, but for others as
well.

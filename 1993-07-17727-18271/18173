Also, some users pick passwords of length <8. For length 4, for example,
your calculations would be dramatically different.

Finally, crackers aren't usually interested in breaking "your" password, in
most cases, but any one. Thus the length of a search is a function of of the
number and distribution of different passwords on a system, since the search
has only to run until the first "hit". (This point was mentioned by another,
and I include it for completeness.)

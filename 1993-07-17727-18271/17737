        Suppose also that it mimics the behavior of a moderately
        well-known virus, thus providing plausible deniability for the
        damage.

        This is one for the white hunters. How about some code that,
        while not viral itself, "virusizes" a disk, ensuring that
        particular files are quickly targetted and that leaves
        convincing debris when it's done? Done well, it could also
        include "personality modules" allowing the user to choose
        which virus is to be simulated.
               
        Cheers,
                Marc

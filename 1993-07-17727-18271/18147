Does anyone know about, or care to comment on this idea?

Writers have often imagined schemes such as mailing themselves a copy of
their manuscript by registered mail, but not opening the package when it
arrives, as a means of asserting legal proof that they own the rights to work
by having an officially dated copy of it in their possession, where the date
can be verified objectively.

Would it be feasible for a writer to send an MD5 hash product to a trusted
individual or service, such as (say) one of the PGP key servers, who would
then log the time stamp of the message digest, which, when notarized or sworn
as factual, could be admitted as evidence in copyright cases?

Is the MD5 hash function used by PGP strong enough? Has its strength ever
been the object of litigation?

Thanks for any advice .....


Cheers!

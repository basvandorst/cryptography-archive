When I started reading this group several months ago, I thought I'd learn a 
little about cryptology. Well that's exactly what I've learned, very little. 
I have however learned quite a bit about David Sternlight and those who fuel 
the wild tangents that this group has spun to, more often than not. I have 
seen numerous requests to split the group, let's do it! There's been talk of 
a moderated group. I don't like this as much, but if that's what it takes, 
let's do it. Let's do whatever we need to do to limit the topic to the 
Science of Cryptography (or about PGP for those in a.s.p).

Me too!

P.S. Could someone post the RSA algorithm, I was trying to explain it to 
a friend, but couldn't remember the formula. a simple example of how it
is applied would help as well.
Thanks,
Rudy

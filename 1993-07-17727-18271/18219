The August 1993 "Scientific American" has an interesting article called
"Mastering Chaos" by Ditto and Pecora.  They describe a system using a
synchonized chaos circuit used for encryption.

p81: "For example, imagine that Bill wants to send a secret message to Al.
Bill has a device that generates a chaotic drive signal, and he has a sub-
system that reacts to the signal in a stable way.  Al has a copy of the
subsystem.  

"Bill translates his secret message into an electronic signal and combines
it with the chaotic output of his subsystem.  Bill then transmits the
encoded message as well as the drive signal.  Anyone who intercepts these
signals will detect only chaotic noise and will be unable to extract any
information (unless, of course, he or she manages to get a copy of Bill's or 
Al's subsystem).

"When Al receives the drive signal, he sends it through his subsystem, which
reproduces the chaotic output of Bill's subsystem.  Al can then subtract this
output from the encoded information signal to recover the secret message.
It is rather easy, as Carroll has demonstrated, to recover signals buried in
chaos.  To build a practical, secure coommunications system, however, engineers
will probably need to develop sophisticated schemes in which the encoding
process involves more than just adding chaos to message signals."

You can apply for a license for almost any situation. The big question 
is whether you are applying for a commercial license or a noncommercial 
license. Commercial license applications are _much_ more complex than 
the form letters I posted.

Now when you say ``free or next to free,'' if you're talking about what 
you have to pay NIST, and you want to use DSA in a commercial product, 
then you're in the tricky case. Talk to John Raubitschek, 202-482-5394.

But if you mean that your software will be free, and you're just worried 
about how to fill out the forms to indicate your unusual application of 
DSA, that's easy. Just add a short description of your application to 
#12. NIST will contact you if they need more information. Remember, this 
isn't a school application; it doesn't have to be complete the first 
time around.

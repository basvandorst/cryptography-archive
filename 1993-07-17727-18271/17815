I was just reading John Kelsey's reply regarding "Cryptanalysis of
Compressed Text".

Anyhow, being un-knowledgable in encryption/decryption/cryptanalysis I
was wondering how secure a message (or file) would be if encrypted
several times.

For example say A sends a message to B over a public channel.  How tough
would a file be if it was...

     PKZipped & Scrambled with a password       then...
     UUEncoded                                  then...
     Encrypted with DES                         then...
     UUEncoded again                            then...
     Encrypted with PGP                         and so forth...

Now the overall encryption/decryption would be quite cumbersome, but how
strong would it be resisting any type of attack.

Thanks.

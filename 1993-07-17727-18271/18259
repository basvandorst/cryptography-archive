Hi,

Here is a question that has been buggin me for a while.
The IP header checksum covers only the header and not the body 
of the message.  So until one hits the TCP layer above, one cannot 
assure the association of the option parameters (IP option 
parameters) with the data.

Would this not leave a vulnerability for any intermediate machine /
device routing IP packets to cut and paste across messages the body 
of messages with the header remainig the same.  This would certainly 
cause unauthorized droping of data packets by firewalls and such devices.
That is there can be a denial of servic situation.

Is there a bug fix (or is this a feature) available for IP.
(of course it is a good idea that IP does the checksoum on the header 
alone to save time - afterall if the header was wrong who cares 
about the data)

Thanx for any net schooling - Srini

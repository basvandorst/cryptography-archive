I know Norton's 'diskwipe' and 'filewipe' (or whatever their exact
names) utilities will overwrite the disk numerous times before
considering the disk safe from reconstruction.  (I think it may be ten
times with alternating writes of 0's and 1's).  Definitely, a single
overwrite isn't likely to be sufficient to fully destroy the original
recording.  I think destroying the media goes a little over the edge
of paranoid, however.

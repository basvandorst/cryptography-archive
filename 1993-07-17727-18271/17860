I doubt that there is a back-door to RSAREF.  If you read the license, you
will find that the front-door is VERY small.  The license dictates that
you only use RSAREF through the supplied interface.  Low-level RSA routines
are not available at this level, the only routines in the interface are
to encrypt/decrypt a message, using DES and an RSA protected session key
and routines for signing a message using RSA and (I think) MD2, or MD4.
You can access the RSA primaries and use them, but it violates the license.
So much for writing a legal version of PGP using RSAREF hooks.  The
license pretty much limits you to implementing RIPEM, which uses the
flawed DES.  Oh well...

   I'm afraid I'm misunderstanding your point; it seems to me that you want

   of 16 or 20 bytes when you use MD5 or SHA, respectively) *instead* of a
   secret key?? In this case the checksum simply acts *as* a secret key but 
   is transmitted in clear. Thus you wouldn't need the secret key in the 

No - what you transmit along with your message is
	Hash( secret-string, message )
which is easily computed with if you have the message and the secret string.
If you have a previous message and the hash, you can possibly reconstruct the
secret string (or an equivalent*) if you can invert the hash function.
With hash functions such as MD-5 or SHA, this is believed to be difficult,
and hoped to require exponential amounts of time (e.g. 2**128 steps).

	  same state as the real secret string does.)

CRCs, however, are easy to reverse.  First of all, a 32-bit CRC requires
only 2**32 tries to crack, which is pretty fast on modern computers;
if you do it often you can store the results on an Exabyte tape.
Additionally, the structure of CRCs is simpler, so you can probably
reverse them with a little bit of algebra, or some algebra + some
brute force, and 2**16 steps of brute force is trivial.

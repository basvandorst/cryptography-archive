   BTW, someone corrected me in email and I promised to correct myself;
the correct title is "Cryptanalysis", not "Cryptology".  Dumb of me.
   That said, yes, it is quite a tome, but I found enough good material
in there to keep me fascinated enough to read through most of it and
actually apply my lazy butt to the problems.

   Ain't _that_ the truth!  But that becomes immediately apparent to anyone
who does a frequency analysis on encrypted computer text and finds that the
most common character in English text isn't E, it's space.  :-)

Actually I believe DS referred to the DES phone security device.  Weakened 
may refer to only having Clipper versions or perhaps only key escrowed
available.

Apparrently there are both DES and CLIPPER telephone security units.

The ad for the Surity(tm) Telephone Device showed a modem sized box (4" X
71/4").

The picture of the AT&T Federal Systems AT&T Telephone Security Device Model 
3600, touting an 'advanced encryption algorithm'(presumably SKIPJACK) shows
a smaller box, looking some what sinister and Darth Vader-ish (although in 
flat matte instead of gloss).

Before buying a pair, I would want to know several things:

    CODEC type (CELP,CVSD,..?)
    Encryption algorithm
    Key management scheme
    Compliance with FedSTD/FIPSPUB
    MODEM standards

The price ($1200.00?)  is probably competitive, but you never know...
It would be nice to come out with a compatible.

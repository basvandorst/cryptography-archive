Oh?  You *can* judge a book by its cover?  :-).

Since Ordinary Mortals have no way of learning what the algorithm is,
we have (thanks to our government) no way of knowing whether 
the same degree of cleverness was applied to both algorithm and package.

Since we can't know, your conclusion can't follow, since its premise can't
be tested -- at least not in "open court".

As far as "little to fear (beyond key compromise)", I yield to (I think)
Will Rogers: "Other than that, Mrs Lincoln, how was the play?"

Now, let me get this straight, according to the original post the clipper
chip is shrouded in a veil of oscillators and various odd, unrelated
pieces of circuitry?  Now I'm no expert in radios, but it seems to me
that if they are playing around with that much free real estate
on that chip, why not put a radio in?  Just crank up the speed on
those oscillators, stick a microwave waveguide in there, and drive
it with the "unrelated" circuitry, and off you go.  Sure, I'm just
daydreaming, but why not?  Is there anything unfeasable here?  And
don't tell me that you can't put microwave antennae on microchips,
because I've seen pictures of 'em.

Come to think of it, wouldn't oscillators be a pretty poor way of
shielding things?  Even a scanning-electron microscope is just
another type of TEMPEST attack.  Wouldn't the best move be to put
the whole thing inside of a faraday cage, and ground that out to
one of the pins?  I suppose capacitance would be a problem.  Oh well.

 It's food for thought...

I propose a new unmoderated group:

talk.politics.crypto   The relation between cryptography and government.

The name of the group needs little explanation. Like talk.politics.drugs
and talk.politics.guns, this newsgroup will cover all sides of a sticky 
issue. There's a lot of existing traffic which would fit very well into
talk.politics.crypto; this group should be reasonably successful at 
drawing inappropriate traffic out of sci.crypt.

Please note that talk.politics.crypto is not meant to foreclose the 
possible future creation of a (moderated) sci.crypt.research group.

Followups to news.groups. I expect to run a vote in a month.

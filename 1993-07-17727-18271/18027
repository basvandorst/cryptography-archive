   Perhaps someone could devise some sort of "Turing Test" for D.S. What
   criteria could one use to objectively test the hypothesis that D.S. is an NSA
   plant? One that seems to be out would be humorous self-deprecation ... a very
   recent posting by "David Sternlight" seems to rule that out? Moreover, it
   would appear to already be proven that a bureaucratic committee masquerading
   as an individual would succumb to the temptation to want to appear to be very
   clever .... all in all, an interesting quandary, eh?

   Tschuess!

	Just stick his name in a kill file (be sure that you do this
for addresses, and not just subjects). Unless, of course, you
find this kind of stuff amusing.  Then we can get back to the subject
at hand -- science & cryptology.
	BTW, I recently read in (I believe) the San Francisco Examiner,
or was it the Chronicle -- I can never remember -- that a 160 digit 
number had just been factored by a consortium of people.  The inevitable
remark, that a lot of crypto techniques would be placed in jeopardy, was
made.  A lot of things can be said about that, i.e., not *all* methods use
the factoring of large primes, only a government will (probably) have the
sheer computational strength to do such a thing (for now), crypto techniques
get more powerful as the ability to decipher becomes more powerful, etc...

I don't think that it's a good idea to use any algorithm with a
single key for such a large volume of random data.  In fact, for this
volume of information, it's not a good idea to use any computational
process at all.

I suggest that you buy a PC based hardware random generator (such as
the one produced by RSA Data Security of Redwood City).  If the
generator doesn't ouput enough data you can use it to seed a good
cryptographic RNG such as MD5.

Andrew.

I am looking for a solution to the following problem.

I have a physically secure box which contains an imbedded processor
collecting data.  I need to transmit the data from the secure box to a laptop.

The laptop must be able to verify that the data did come from the alleged
sender, and that the file has not been tampered with.  It is desireable
that the file remain in cleartext with a signature appended to it.

The algorithm should be public domain.

If you have a thoughtful suggestion, I would be grateful.  You can reply
to my e-mail, if posting the answer is not appropriate.

Thanks!

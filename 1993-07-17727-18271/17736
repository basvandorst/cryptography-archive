I am looking for a program that will "wipe" a file, so that the file
can never be recovered.  I know, the only way to be sure is to destroy
the media, but I'm looking for something less extreme.  I want a
program which:

	* Overwrites every character in the file, possibly several
	  times, with either with constant data or with random data.
	* Overwrites the filename (by moving the file so some other
	  name).
	* Removes the file.
	* And in general makes it as difficult as possible to recover
	  the file.

I could write this program myself, it would be quite simple.  But this
seems like an obvious idea, which probably has been done many times
before.  I'm looking for source code, so that I can use this on both
my UNIX workstation and my PC at home.

Can anyone help me?

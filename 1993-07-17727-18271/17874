   Ah, the old "Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately
explained by stupidity" trick.  (Didn't Maxwell Smart say that?  :-)

   Suuuuuuuuure.  Like the 55 MPH speed limit, the giving away of the Panama
Canal, etc.  Suuuuuuure, I want my taxes increased while Congress goes on a
profligate spending spree with it.  Suuuuuuuuure, the vast majority of people,
who can barely (or can't at all) afford an acre for their home want to give
each spotted owl 30,000 acres apiece.  (Not that I personally am against
preserving the species, y'understand, but thirty thousand acres per owl???)
   In America, unless you attack an entitlement program, no one gives a good
hoot enough to do anything about it (with very few exceptions).

   Which makes it a done deal, so who cares about public opinion?  Try to find
a majority of the American people interested enough in cryptosecurity that
they'd demonstrate in front of the White House.

   But that's the way it's usually done anyway.  Public opinion is often
gauged by asking "experts"; if not those on either side of the issue, then
by those who call themselves "pollsters".

   Most of the people won't be talking about it until the Wall Street Journal
or the Washington Post comes out with an expose, AFTER millions of the phones
have been sold.  By then it's a standard.

   Not being familiar with them, I can't comment accurately; but I'll bet
they don't give the full depth of what's really inside that little plastic
chip.

   THAT it is!

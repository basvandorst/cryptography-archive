Let's be somewhat more specific here.  Xuejia Lai and James Massey say
in their article "Differential Cryptanalysis and Markov Ciphers" that
most probably a differential attack on IDEA would require on the order
of 2^64 encryptions.  This *is* faster than exhaustive key search, but
note that the attacker, with 2^64 encryptions, has the complete
mapping of plaintext to ciphertext, and thus doesn't need to find the
actual key.  (Also, generating these 2^64 encryptions would probably
take too much time.)

The best attack on DES I know of requires on the order of 2^47
encryptions.  However, this does not imply that DES can be broken
faster than via exhaustive key search because the analysis of those
2^47 plaintext/ciphertext pairs might take up too much time.

Have fun.

It's nothing that sinister.  It's simply for ease of system administration;
the usual reason for booting a machine single-user is that something has
been munged, and you want the minimal boot process to rely on as few
components as possible.  Getting access to /usr/lib/ld.so requires that
/usr and /usr/lib be reasonably intact, and that /usr be mountable.
You can't always count on that.

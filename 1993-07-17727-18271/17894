Appendix A is a RSA statement. However, I for one don't think this
is a condition they would impose if they where not 'encouraged' to
do so by others.

This strikes me as another attempt to mandate key-eschrow by a non-
legislative means. And it is not required to get congress to vote on
it to get it to happen.

Is RSA being required by NIST or any other govt agency to impose the KE
condition on RSAs licencies?

Exactly.  Encryption is powerless if the host player could easily
single-step and capture the decrypted version of the other players'
turn files.

You are correct; Encryption will not provide seamless protection until
you can find a way to protect the host player's program from
single-stepping.

This algorithm is essentially the one that WordPerfect uses (actually
it's somewhat weaker); several people have written programs that crack
encrypted WordPerfect documents in very little time.  

But a somewhat-weak algorithm may or may not matter, depending on how
high you see the energy barrier to single-stepping the host program
is.  

It just has to be harder to break the encryption than it is to
reverse-engineer the host program.  You won't get perfect security,
but you will be able to remove the temptation to cheat -- if you were
shipping the turn files around as plaintext then the temptation would
be too strong, but if one would have to get their hardware-supported
debugger and set a bunch of breakpoint etc, perhaps they'll take the
time to think about the ideals of fair play and good sportsmanship.

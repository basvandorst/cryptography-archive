I havn't seen the example cited.  Maybe you could provide more details. 
I'm not sure what the "Not entirely true" refers to. 

The technique implied here, I believe, is a mixture of Steganographic and
Cryptographic techniques, not just Steganography: ("She uses a
Steganographic algorithm in which the position of the next letter is
governed by the next integer in a *key*"). (My *)  The "key" attribute
would tend to imply a Cryptographic applique below the Steganographic
layer.  

Cryptography provides a mathematical mechanism which enhances the
analytical security of manycommunication systems:  It also flags traffic
as important or secret, or may identify the sender or receiver as someone
with something to hide.  It has been lethal by association. (So were
radio transmitters in some European environments in 1943)

Steganography attempts to subvert the knowledge an <important> message
even exist, avoiding some of these Cryptographic downsides. 
Steganography is often employed by parties which have something to loose
should their communications (not necessairly the content) are discovered.
  The two are very distinct.

True, when the two are combined (assuming competence of design), a
powerful communications security mechanism exist, but that may add
complexity, cost or risk.
Many Steganographic systems only require eyeballs, a brain and knowledge
of  the system, not a PC with Triple DES, or other tools. A complex
algorithm may reduce the probability of correct reception and decode.  
From a practical standpoint, Users may or may not be capable of, or feel
the need for encrypting Steganographic communications, depending upon the
advisary, communications channel, risk assessment, probability of
detection, etc...  

Hope that helps.

Information about Digital Signatures needed:

I'm interested in the following:

a)	I have a document - not secret.

b)	One or more persons (A, B, etc. ) must authorize it - just
	like putting his/hers signature on it.

c)	This information (the document and the signature)
	should be stored in a database.

d)	This information will later be sent to the
	authorities (FDA in this case).

e)	They should be able to verify that mr A and mrs B
	actually have "signed" these documents.

Does anyone have any information about this - more specifically:

a)	How deep should the signature be in order to be just
	as difficult/easy to copy as a normal signature?

b)	Does anyone know of a similar situation, i.e. some authority
	(maybe not just FDA) has accepted a digital signature?

Any information would be appreciated.

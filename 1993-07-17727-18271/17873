   Right, the bandwidth is absolutely TERRIBLE.  Probably about one word
per minute at standard rates.  Suggested to me either a VERY important
message or something using superencoding.  The numbers stations found on
shortwave seem terribly more efficient to me.

   Well, it's in the Chicago area, between five and fifteen miles from me.

   Funny thing is, I was beginning to suspect the same thing, but the
transmissions first went directional and then stopped altogether (or went
somewhere else I haven't found yet).  And I don't think I tipped off any
drug lords or hobbyists, considering the people I called...

   Well, it would take a pretty savvy crook to know about PGP at all, but
I get your premise and pretty well agree.

   It's expected and told to anyone who calls.  It ranks among the most
stupid things I've ever done, my calling the FBI like that.  Frankly, in
future, even if I found anything purporting to be of national importance
in the future, it would be sent through a friend buried somewhere in a huge
corporation, laser printed on a common printer, handled with latex gloves
and mailed to the gov't.

   Cell, yes, but I don't think there's anything wrong with listening to
coded or encrypted transmissions, just to disseminating the information you
get or using it for personal benefit.  I would HOPE the FBI would have warned
me about listening to such at the time I told them I was doing so, or at
least have arrested me by now.

Note that cross-reference to the Treasury's regulations, particularly 27 CFR

Who within the USG has classified them as defense articles?  

If you mean that it is cryptographic software, then it is on the U.S. 
Munitions List that is included in the ITAR, but it is not on the U.S. 
Munitions Import List that is used by the Treasury to determine whether 
something is a defense article that requires a license before it can be 
legally imported.

Not by the treasury for import licensing purposes.

Vain hope.  The truth will out.

The AI's inference engine seems to be working fairly well, but the knowledge 
base is kaput.

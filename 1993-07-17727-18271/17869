Yeah, the term "digital ready" has been meaningless ever since the
stereo stores started stamping it on all their usual accessories
(headphones, etc) when the CD came out. I never could get the salesmen
to explain exactly what it was supposed to mean.

Anyway, back to cell phone crypto, I'm afraid that the state of
affairs is such that if a user wants true privacy, he can't rely on
anyone but himself to provide it. This is due as much to general
market apathy/unawareness as to NSA/FBI pressure. It didn't take much
of the latter to convince the industry to not do something it really
didn't care much about in the first place.

The most we can probably hope for is a sufficiently capable generic
cellular data service over which a customer could do end-to-end
encryption if he is sufficiently motivated. Unfortunately, this
approach requires a secure telephone on the land side of the
connection even if the user is only concerned with interception of the
RF link.

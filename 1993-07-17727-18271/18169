If you consider distance (city block metric) and counting arguments, it is
fairly easy to see that any good hash function must have this property for
almost all sets of plain text!  A better way of thinking of it is that this
property arises from 'randomness' and any significant breach of 'randomness'
is a cryptographic weakness (use information theory to prove this standard
result).

As more than one later poster pointed out, the practical security arises
from the fact that there is no known way of finding suitable 'errors' other
than trial-and-error.

[A long description of a simple thing deleted for brevity]

Let us call the "chaotic drive" a cryptographically random signal source.
	[Actually it doesn't even matter whether
	 it is truly random or pseudorandom.]
Let us call the "stable-way-reacting subsystem" an encryption function.
Let us take that "Al has a copy of the subsystem" means
"A and B share a key to that encryption function"

What we have here is a classical private-key cryptosystem.
With the added complication that half of the bandwith is wasted
by sending a random data stream _twice_ (once added to the ciphertext
message and once by itself).

What's the news and where's the benefit?

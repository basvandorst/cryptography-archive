How do you KNOW this? And how can it be proven? I'm not disputing your claim,
I'm just curious how you arrived at it.

Btw. What is the length of an MD5 hash? I understand the idea behind a hash
in general, but I fear I don't know the specifics of MD5.  Is it those thirty
characters long which you hint at? Is it simply that a hash function has
a domain of all alphanumeric strings, and a range of all strings of length
L (for example 30), and it is the case that for a message M, mapping to hash
H, there (almost) always exist a1...aL for every message M', such that
M1-a1-a2-...-aL has hash H?  This would indeed be a nice property for a hash 
to have, since it would mean that the hash had a *very strong* sort of 
nonlinearity.  But can we really show such a thing for a particular function
like MD5? And what about the 'almost' which I felt rather compelled to add?
Is there any way to get rid of the 'almost' by allowing more than L a's?

Yours, Lulu...

	Pages 46-48 of the July 1993 Bulletin discuss
computer bridge programs.  As I understand it,
you play at one computer, partner at a second machine,
and the opponents elsewhere, perhaps different states.
Two of the versions described (Sierra Network, Tel-A-Bridge)
may soon be awarding masterpoints.

	An obvious strategy by dishonest partners is to play at
neighboring terminals, where each can see his partner's hand.
Or one player might play both hands, using two windows on one 
terminal (perhaps with one window connected to a machine in another city).
There are many variations, such as talking to each other
on a telephone while playing computer bridge on their terminals.

	How can such dishonest practices be detected?

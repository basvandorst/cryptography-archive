Sure.  Fast enough to be implemented in software on a 386SX/16 and
encrypt at 2k/second with plenty of time left over for the voice
compression.  AFAIK, none of the cyphers considered to be really strong
go that fast, and all we have left to trade in for speed is security,
so the cypher is weakened to make it fast enough.

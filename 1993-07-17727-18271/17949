Perhaps you shouldn't post on Monday mornings, either (Garfield would have

Correct ...

Simply divide s2 by c (mod p-1, which should be possible for many values of 
c) and multiply the result by the hash c' of another message of your choice. 
Thus such a signature is a blank one.

Why wouldn't you stay with the NIST DSA for this purpose? Even if you 
increase the modulus to 1024 bits, the size of the signature is only 
determined by the size of the multiplicative subgroup used (presently 2*160 
bit).

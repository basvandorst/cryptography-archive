I am looking for information sources on the A5 crypto used in
the GSM digital cellular systems.  It was developed by British
Telecom.  Any pointers would be appreciated.

BTW for those who are wondering... cellular calls on GSM systems
are actually encrypted!  Not like the 'anyone with a scanner can
listen' analog stuff used by most cellular vendors.  

These calls are so in the clear that US courts have stated
anyone making such a call is assumed to have given up privacy
rights :(    IE... no wiretap court order required...  Bet
Princess Di wishes she had used a GSM phone :)

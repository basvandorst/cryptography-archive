Just to throw it out threre the NSA offers internships that pay alot of
money to people that they feel have potential or original ideas in
these areas.  They activly seek people who have beaten used cypher
systems, people with inovative ideas about factoring, set, and largwe
number theory.  What might be of interest to someone out there is that
they have recently expressed an interest in people working in
fractials an chaoss.  Can you imagine useing a specific 3D cordinate
in a Mandelbrot (excuse the spelling its late) set as the start of a
five character identification set.  Ponder that for a while, I will
say no more about it.  
    One of the places they recruit openly is Rose Hulman
Institute of Technology in Terra Haute IN.  THis is one of the premier
Gek schools in the nation 1200 male mathmatitions scientists and
engineers with no social life to styfol their net time.  From hackers
such as those does Big Brothers LARGET INTELIGENCE AGENCY get its
people.


The thought that they are behind the power curve in crypto is ludicris.

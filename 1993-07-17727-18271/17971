	A story in Tuesday's NY Times (first business page) claimed that on
Wednesday NOVELL INC would announce a new computer security package that 
they would promote as an encryption standard to battle Clipper/Capstone.

	The article said that Novell wanted its product to become a 
standard for reasons that industries were too resistant to choose Clipper
because of the backdoor.  It also said that the new system made use of 
two technologies - RSA's Public Key Encryption (patented by PKP) and DES.

     PKP wants everyone to use THEIR version of RSA.
     Did PKP disable or put in a back door?  Am I being too paranoid
     when I see PKP forcing us to use THEIR version of RSA? 

Yes, you're being too paranoid :-)
The nice thing about source code is you can see what it's doing.
The RSA algorithm implementation looks fine; it accurately performs
the well-known algorithm, though better performance may be possible.

One of their big concerns (other than retaining control, of course) 
is to make sure that you don't build a wimpy breakable implementation
using RSAREF which would make them look bad because of *your* mistakes.

The interesting restrictions (which *are* negotiable) are
- Use only the interfaces they provide, which don't let you do
	the RSA yourself.
- Use of single-DES encryption for the messages
	Boring, with known limitations, but triple-DES has been negotiated.
- Use of *their* random number generator, which basically uses
	MD-5 hashing to generate each successive round.
	It looks strong to me, assuming the NSA hasn't broken MD-5;
	random-number generators are a common weakness in badly
	implemented cryptosystems, and it's probably better than DES.

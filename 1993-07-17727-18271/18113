Hello!

Some of the readers of this group are just interested amateurs like
myself, and might be interested in knowing that a good introduction
to cryptology is inside the _Encyclopaedia_Britannica_ (Macropaedia) on
"Cryptology". This should be available at all universities and libraries
and is a good "getting started" to read with the excellent FAQ of this
group.

Sorry for wasted bandwidth. Professionals: please continue your discussion
now ;-)

Regards
Jan Steinar Haugland

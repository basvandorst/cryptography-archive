   Could someone tell me where i could find it??

You can try looking at PGP, which has an RSA implementation, or
RSAREF, which has both RSA and DES algorithms.  RSAREF is available
via anonymous ftp to rsa.com in some directory that you will have to
find.  PGP is available also via anonymous ftp, and you can use archie
to find your favorite ftp site...

Hope this helps..

Actually, there are protocols for secure or private computation that
might be fun to work into a game (although you wouldn't want to do
this if you need to compute a lot of stuff from the individual players'
data, and it seems like overkill for a game).

In particular, consider the following problem:  you are in a group of
people, and you're curious what the average salary of the group is, but
no-one wants to tell anyone their individual salary.  There is
no trusted person (the "host" in your example) that you can send all
of the individual salaries to in order to compute the average.
It turns out that you can indeed compute this where no information
about individual salaries is given away --- even if a group of people
gets together to pool their information and try to figure out info
on someone outside of the group.  I believe that it turns out that
you can do such a private computation for *any* function over a finite
domain.

I'm a little hazy on the details (it's been a while since I saw this
stuff), but I believe that the protocol requires secure pair-wise
communication between all the parties involved in the protocol.  The
name I remember from this work is Chor --- the papers on this were in
FOCS or STOC within the last 6 years.

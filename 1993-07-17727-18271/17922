Especially if there were a digest timer of some sort.  Every week, in
alt.security.keydist, you post your new .signature key for that week
saying when it comes into effect and when it expires.  That message you
sign with your secure key, which I already trust.  You then post to
alt.something and sign the datestamped message with your .signature key.
If I receive the message before the expiration of your .signature key I
*know* for a fact that attackers have only had since the key incept to
break that key, so they probably haven't managed it.

If I receive the message long after that, say if I look it up in an
archive, I have a different problem because I can't be sure it really
did get sent out before the key expired.  For this reason we need some
sort of message dating site, preferably with a daily posting to
alt.security.keydist and a regular small ad in the New York Times.  It
need only be twenty-two characters.  I'm sort of surprised it hasn't
been done already.

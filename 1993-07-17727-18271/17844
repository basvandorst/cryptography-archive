DES is an encryption ALGORITHM; just saying 'DES' still leaves open
the question of how you store your keys and how you synchronize on a
key with your correspondent.  There are a zillion different ways to
have DES encryption; there are chips that perform DES, there are
hundreds of different programs that use the DES algorithm.  Just
because you're using DES, which is generally agreed mostly unbreakable
if you use triple-encryption, doesn't mean you're secure.  Depends on
how you use it.

PGP is not a 'method', PGP is a particular program that does two
things: Key exchange using the RSA public-key algorithm, and symmetric
encryption using the IDEA algorithm.  IDEA is not as old as DES; it's
not known whether it's stronger or weaker.

DES is symmetric.  PGP uses RSA (which is not symmetric) to exchange
keys for IDEA, which is symmetric.  You're comparing apples to FCOJ.

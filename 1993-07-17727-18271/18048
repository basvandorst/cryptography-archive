What's wrong with DES chips already available today, like the AM9518 used
in the Sun 3/60 for example. From the datasheet:

* Encrypts and decrypts data
  Implements National Bureau of Standards standard data encryption
  algorithm

* High-Speed Operation
  AM9518 and AMZ8068 throughput over 1.3 and 1.7 Mbytes per second,
  respectively. Operates at data rates fast enough for disk controllers,
  high-speed DMA, telecommunication channels.

* Supports three ciphering options
  Electronic Code Book for disk applications. Chain Block Cipher for
  high-speed telecommunications. Cipher Feedback for low-to-medium
  speed, byte oriented communications.

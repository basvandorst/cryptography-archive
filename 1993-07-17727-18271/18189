Now here's a question about block ciphers with cipher block chaining.
Now it occures to me that block ciphers with fairly small block sizes
(eg. DES) the initial value used in the chaining has little value (ie.
knowing it only helps the deciphering of the first block, beyond
that it is of no use).

So given this, would it not be more useful to set the initial value
randomly for each encryption and then send this value along with the
ciphertext. As I stated above, as far as I can see secrecy over the
inital value of such a cipher system has little value as far as I can
see, and as far as I can tell using a random initial value would bring
advatages against certain types of cryptanalysis (eg. differential,
due to that fact that the same plaintext encrypted with the same key
would produce different ciphertext).

If you really felt uncomfortable about sending the initial value you
could always encrypt it using the cipher algorigthm (no chaining), but
I don't think this is highly useful.

The question is have a missed something major in the above, and also
does a random initital value actually make some methods of
cryptanalysis more difficult (as suggested above).

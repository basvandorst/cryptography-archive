I thought the Clipper condition had nothing to do with Bidzos and RSA. It is
strictly for those who would make Clipper chips, and requires them to
support the escrow feature if they are to be allowed so to do. There's
nothing new in that from the original Clipper deal, before any
RSA/PKP-related issues arose about digital signatures.

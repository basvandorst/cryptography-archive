This thread has been hashing around (if you'll pardon a slightly lame
pun :-) ) the security of Unix passwords, with most of the discussion
focusing on  N^l  arguments for suitable character set sizes  N  and
password lengths  l .  Unfortunately, passwords are far less secure in
practice than such arguments would indicate, because (as a few other
posters have pointed out) real-life passwords aren't even close to random.



At the end of this article I give 5 references which IMHO *anyone*
interested in Unix security should read (presuming that Garfinkel
and Spafford is already in <books.h> and /etc/motd combined :-) ...).

Of these references, [125] describe the statistical characteristics
of actual real-world Unix passwords (gathered with due concern for
security and privacy risks, discussed in the papers), while [34] are
"war stories" which give a few insights about some of the less friendly
people who inhabit the internet.  References [125] also describe several
large-scale (> 1 workstation cpu-year) password-cracking studies.



Two quotes that are particularly relevant to this thread:

Reference [1] was based on a set of ~15000 /etc/passwd lines the
author gathered.

"All in all, after nearly 12 CPU months of rather exhaustive testing
approximately 25% of the
passwords had been guessed.  So that you do not develop a false sense
of security too early, I add that 21% (nearly 3,000 passwords) were
guessed in the first week, and that in the first 15 minutes of testing,
368 passwords (or 2.7%) had been cracked using what experience has
shown would be the most fruitful line of attack (i.e., using the user
or account names as passwords).  These statistics are frightening,
and well they should be.  On an average system with 50 accounts in
the /etc/passwd file, one could expect the first account to be cracked
in under 2 minutes [of cracker cpu time], with 5-15 accounts being
cracked by the end of the first day."




Reference [5] was based on installing special versions of  passwd
and  yppasswd  on a variety of machines over a 6 month periods,
which logged the newly set passwords (RSA encrypted for security).

"Of the 13787 unique password entries examined, the average length
was 6.80 characters.  The lengths of passwords are given in table 1.

	Table 1: Password lengths

	Length		Quantity
	------------------------
	1		55
	2		87
	3		212
	4		449
	5		1260
	6		3035
	7		2917
	8		5772


	Table 2: Character distributions

Characters			Count	Percentage
--------------------------------------------------
Lower-case only			3988	28.9%
Mixed case			5259	38.1%
Some upper-case			5641	40.9%
Digits				4372	31.7%
Meta-characters			  24	 0.2%
Control characters		 188	 1.4%
Space and/or tab		 566	 4.1%
.,;				 837	 6.1%
-_=+				 222	 1.6%
!#$%^&*()			 654	 4.7%
Other non-alphanumeric		 229	 1.7%



In conclusion: (mine, not the above-cited authors)...
On almost all Unix systems not in a ultra-high-security environment,
~10% of the accounts have trivial passwords (guessable in under 10
tries using /etc/passwd information only), and another 20% of the
accounts could be cracked within a few minutes of CPU time.

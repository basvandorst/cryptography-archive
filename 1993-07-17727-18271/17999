If PKP gets awarded a patent, that's a certain amount of precedent,
	especially since their products are novel and original,
	though their claims look really broad and patents on use
	of mathematical algorithms don't sound like good public policy to me.
If PKP can sue you for infringement, and win, that's a precedent they can use.
If PKP can sue you for infringement, and *you* win, that's a precedent you and 
	almost anybody else can use.
If PKP can sue you for infringement, and you win, and you get awarded
	legal costs because your case is really substantial,
	that's precedent also.
If PKP can sue you for infringement, and you think you've got a winnable case,
	but you don't have enough precedent to be fairly sure you'll get
	awarded legal costs, you'd probably better settle.

The first kind of precedent is set.  Until the second or third kind
gets set, you're not real likely to be in the fourth category,
which means you're probably in the fifth.  Big hairy lawsuits are expensive,
and most of the people who have deep enough pockets to pull them off
have found it's simpler and cheaper to pay PKP their commission.
It may be cheaper to convince politicians to change the patent laws,
or wait until 1997 or 2000.

AT&T offered them for sale. Not vaporware. Unfortunately the price is a bit
above the budget of those with no solid commercial need (economically
justifiable) for security, since the boxes, which your phone plugs into,
cost $1200 per end. Thus right now they are probably going to be used for
individual links rather than general calling. Fine for commercial companies
who need, for example, to scramble calls from New York to London or Chicago
offices.

No word yet on when, if at all, cellular versions will be available, but one
assumes not long. Since the cellular ones will probably be built-in, and
since people aren't as willing to replace existing cell phones, my guess is
that they will be built into the new digital (CDMA, TDMA) phones. The price
probably won't be that much higher than the phone itself, I speculate, and
since those who want digital cellular have to buy new phones anyway, it
makes sense.

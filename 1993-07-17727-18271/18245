Richard,

It sounds like you need a public key encryption system.  As to many of
you specific needs, you'll find them moot (ie. if an A becomes an M...).
The main reason for this is that there is not necessarily a simple
translation like that.

RSA public key encryption will likely serve your needs and, if properly
implement on your system, will be highly secure and likely unbreakable.
RSA is the defacto standard for public key encryption.  It is used by
Microsoft, Sun, Apple, Lotus, and many others.

One implementation of the RSA system may be found in PGP (Pretty Good
Privacy).  You can find more info on PGP on alt.security.pgp. Also Hugh
Miller <info-pgp-request@lucpul.it.luc.edu> can tell you all about it
and where to get the latest version for your system.

Make sure you read the PGP documentation very carefully.  Not only will
it give you a _much_ better understanding of public key cryptology, it
also contains some disclaimers which you should read.

Another implemenation of RSA can be found in RSAREF.  RSAREF is legal
for non-comercial use and may suit your needs just fine.  Although I
don't recall where to get it, I sure someone on the feed will pipe in.

Hmmm. When I see "investigative TV" I think Geraldo. I'd lump him in with
A Current Affair, Hard Copy, and similar sleazoid shows. Do any of them
work out of Washington?

I don't think ANY of the really sleazy shows are in DC. Maybe it's a front
for Nightline. Or, maybe, just maybe, the granddaddy of all these programs,
ie 60 Minutes! Dare I dream that Mike Wallace would do the cross-examining?

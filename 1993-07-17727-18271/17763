I've certainly spent some time looking at it. As far as I can see the
only weaknesses are: use of single key DES (which has been fixed) and 
the random number generation, which depends on the security of MD5. Of 
course, if MD5 is broken, PGP, RIPEM and TIS/PEM digital signatures 
are also probably worth very little.

But sure, find a weakness. Please try, it is in all of our interests.

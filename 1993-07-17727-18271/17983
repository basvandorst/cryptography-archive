Another popular theory is that the David Sternlight postings are a
clever way to get people as emotionally and intellectually committed
as possible to fight fiercely against various key escrow proposals by
the NSA, the FBI and such.

Note that it is entirely within the possibilities for both these
theories to be true and even for David Sternlight to be a real
person.  He might be getting paid both by the NSA people and the
pro-liberty people, both thinking the postings are working to their
advantage ;-)

The _real_ truth of course is David Sternlight is paid by the
coalition of storage device manufacturers and phone companies to
increase their revenue, plus also a minor contribution from the SETI
people because of the increase in electromagnetic radiation leaving
Earth to space which just might make the aliens notice us.

No offence intended,

		ASIACRYPT'94 - Call for Papers
	   University of Wollongong, NSW, Australia
		    November 28 - December 1, 1994

The Asiacrypt'94 conference is a continuation of the Auscrypt'90,
Asiacrypt'91 and Auscrypt'92 conference series.
The Asiacrypt conferences are the third, after Crypto and Eurocrypt,
and the youngest stream of workshops devoted to the theory and
applications of cryptology.

Asiacrypt'94 is sponsored by the University of Wollongong,
Australia, in cooperation with the International Association
for Cryptologic Research.  The conference will be held on
the University of Wollongong campus, Wollongong, New South Wales,
Australia.

Instructions for authors:
Authors are invited to submit original papers,
neither published nor submitted for publication elsewhere,
by sending 14 copies of an extended abstract containing
at most 10 pages of 12pt type (title page and bibliography
are not counted) to the Program Chair.
Extended abstracts should begin with a succinct statement of
the problem, the results achieved, their significance, and a
comparison with previous work. They should be written in a
manner understandable to a non-specialist reader.
Technical exposition directed to the specialist should
follow as needed.

of the authors should be displayed on the title page

to keep track of the submissions. The other 13 copies should
give the title of the paper with no indication of who the
authors are.

  I guess then I don't understand what the big deal is.  PKP wants everyone to
user THEIR version of RSA.  Did PKP disable or put in a back door?  Am
I being too paranoid when I see PKP forcing us to use THEIR version of RSA?

   I still contend that PKP is under direct controll of NSA purly from the 
actions that I have seen them take.  Remember, it is NSA's job to slow 
technology (especially cripto), what better whay than to give PKP 
the ligit comercial power to controll licensing of cripto.  How is it that
the government spends my money on something then gives it to someone else
to make me pay for it?  Mabe I don't know what I am talking about so 
just say "flame".

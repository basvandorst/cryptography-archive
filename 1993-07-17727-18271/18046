If I understand this announcement, this will be less than
five man months of evaluation (using only tools made 
available by the government).  I once heard Walt Tuchman
say that IBM had invested 17 man years in the 
standardization of the DES.  

While these are all eminent people, I am afraid that I will
know nothing more after hearing their reports than I know
now. <That is, the mechanism has no obvious flaws.)
I am somewhat surprised that they will lend their
reputations to such a suspect effort.

It will be interesting to see if any of these experts will
comment upon whether or not all keys are equally strong.

Actually, there is a slightly different tired argument about which
I'm not sure precedent has been set. After the Supremes ruled that
a patent could in fact be granted on an invention that consisted in
large part of software (before the 80s, remember, any software made
an invention unpatentable as a mathematical formula), the patent office
began issuing patents for inventions that consisted largely (or in
some cases for practical purposes entirely) of software, or even
of (ahem) mathematical formulae. I don't know whether that overbreadth
issue has been properly settled.

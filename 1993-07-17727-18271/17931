I don't agree with your interpretation.  It says licenses will be
available to practice standards.  Quote:

"...for the integrated circuits..."

This part means that chip and component mfrs can get a license if they
choose to.  Chip mfrs can acquire the license, simplifying (or
eliminating) licensing for product and system builders.

"...which will implement both the DSA and the anticipated 
                                              ^^^^^^^^^^^
Federal Information Processing Standard for the key escrow..."
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

So, licenses will be granted for FIPS.  NIST makes FIPS for the
government.  (The "F" *is* for Federal...)

The announcement says that if a FIPS develops, and anyone in the
private sector elects to use that FIPS, licenses will be available.
There's nothing that says you *have* to use a FIPS.  (Note: Key escrow
is not a FIPS at this time.  Of course, it's not a secret that parts
of the government would like it to be.)

It also does NOT say (as your interpretation implies it does) that
these are the only conditions under which you can get a license.
(There are currently no FIPS for public-key, but we have many
licensees.)  The announcement simply ensures access to patents and a
level playing field for private sector use of any future FIPS that may
be covered by patents listed in the announcement.  

Some people actually believe the government was doing their job,
ensuring such access (especially for the Schnorr patent, which the
govt had NO rights to) for potential private sector use of government
standards before adopting them.

Exponential key exchange and RSA without key escrow are not FIPSs, but
companies such as IBM, ATT, Motorola, NT, Cylink, TRW, GE, etc.  have
licenses to use them.  (There are currently over 1.5 million products
using such EKE and/or RSA in the market today, ranging from secure
phones and faxes to email and e-forms that don't do key escrow.)

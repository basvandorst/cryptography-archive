Hi there,

I would like to know if there are theoretically secure 
one-way-hashfunctions. By this I mean that any attack can be 

  proved to be equivalent to some well-known hard problem

like factoring or the discrete log.

The one-way-hashfunctions I have found in the literature like MD5 or SHS 
seem to be "DES-like": some simple function is performed very often and the
resulting function seems to be somehow "chaotic". I can't see any way to
prove hashfunctions like theese really to be "one-wy".

So I want to raise the following questions:
  1. Are there results that show that Functions like MD5 ore SHS are secure
     (under some reasonable cryptographic assumption)?
  2. Are there one-way-hashfunctions that can be shown to be secure under
     some reasonable cryptographic assumption?

THANK YOU

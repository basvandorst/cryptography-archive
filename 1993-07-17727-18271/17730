I think that you are misunderstanding the message that I posted. When
I said "don't use compression with DOS PGP 2.2", I did not mean that
you should not encrypt compressed files. Instead, I meant that you
should tell PGP not to try to compress the message itself. In
particular, you should put a line that says "compress=off" in your
CONFIG.TXT file.

   Two other references that amateurs like you and me should take a glance at:
the first is the first book I ever read on the subject (in 4th grade), called
"Codes and Secret Writing" by Herbert S. Zim.  Basic, but covers a lot of
different ciphers and is just enough to pique your interest.  The other is
one that's MUCH more detailed and requires a bit of study, but is worth it;
it's "Cryptology" by Helen Fouche Gaines.  This one is a bit hard to find
(I stumbled across a copy in a bookstore once, never ever saw it before or
again) and gets into some very good material such as solution of
polyalphabetic substitution ciphers.
   That said, anyone know any _basic_ books on computer cryptology?  My
math only goes through trigonometry, and there are gaping holes in my
algebra (beyond "college algebra", that is).
   For that matter, what kinds of math are important to understanding
modern computer cryptology?

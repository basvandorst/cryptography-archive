Regarding "MindWare" (in case the subject is lost in the dozen or so
newsgroups this was posted to....I'm tempted to trim the followup, but
to what end?):

Be advised that a company based in Santa Cruz is already named
MindWare and sells computer software, mind machines, intelligence
toys, and the like, via a glossy catalog.

Your new venture overlaps a lot with it. I suspect you'll be changing
your name pretty soon.

Otherwise, good luck!

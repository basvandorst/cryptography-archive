      Unfortunately I don't see any real opportunity for a workable compromise. 
      The US laws in this area are simply too restrictive (ie re import/export).

      Whatever system is adopted it will be illegal to export the code from Europe
      to the US or vice versa under the US self imposed COCOM restriction. 
      So effort will have to be diverted into separate developments in any case.

   Things are better, and worse, that you're portraying them.
   - It's legal to export descriptions of algorithms just about anywhere.
   - It's legal to import crypto software into the US.
   - It may or may not be legal to export crypto software from outher countries.
   - It's partly legal to export crypto software from the US;
	   licenses are granted on a case-by-case basis.
	   Authentication-only software like Unix password encryption
	   is much easier to get approval for than full encryption/decryption.

My I add:

   - Any PD encryption program written in US somehow makes it everywhere in
     the world in about a week.

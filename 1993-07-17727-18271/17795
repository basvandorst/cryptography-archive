On an invitation from David Kahn, I am preparing an article for 
"Cryptologia" on the "The (Five Great) Inventions of Twentieth 
Century Cryptography."  While somewhat arbitrary, I suggest that 
these are 1) automatic encoding and decoding, 2) the long key 
variable, 3) complexity-based ciphers (e.g., DES), 4) asymmetric key
cryptography (e.g., RSA), and 5) automatic key management.  The last
is defined as the automatic generation, distribution, installation,
storage, and timely change of keys.  

The invention of the first four is historically documented.  That of
the fifth is not.  

I am trying to identify the inventor(s) of this mechanism.  Please 
send me your nominations by email.  Please cite any authority for
your nomination that you can.  Patents are preferred; papers are next
best.

Thank you for your help.

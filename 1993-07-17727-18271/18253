Kerberos is not an encryption standard per se. It is the name for a
protocol and software implementations thereof that permit strong
authentication across insecure networks without having to pass secret
(e.g. password) information in cleartext, as well as optionally
providing data stream integrity checking and secrecy. PC Week errs in
calling it a "new" standard -- Kerberos has been around for many years,
although there is a new version (v5) in beta test, which may have
confused the article author. The comp.protocols.kerberos newsgroup is
dedicated to Kerberos discussion and has an FAQ (also available in
news.answers) that may answer your questions more thoroughly.

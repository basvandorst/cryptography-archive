Not to mention that if you can rewrite the software to do encryption,
handshaking, etc, you can also rewrite it to put your cellphone into
promiscuous mode, to tap and/or spoof any selected number and all that
other good stuff in which there is also a kernel of valid government
interest. Until the design of cellphone hardware and software becomes
noticeably more secure and modular than is now the case, lots of
people are probably going to take a dim view of rolling your own...

paul   wondering if there's actually enough processor power there to
       do anything useful anyway

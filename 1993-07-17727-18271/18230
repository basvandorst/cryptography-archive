There's a new Springer UTM out on the elementary side of modern number
theory.  I saw it in a store about a month ago, I vaguely recall that
Koblitz was one of the two authors, and among other things, they worked
out in slow motion an application of Lenstra's algorithm.  I was impressed,
but not enough to break my budget at the time.

Sorry I can't be more specific, but I'm sure someone else can identify
the exact book.  It looks like the perfect introduction for someone who
can turn the crank but can get baffled by the modern lingo.

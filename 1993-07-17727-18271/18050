Also since the escrow agencies are not around yet, they can
not get random samples of the chip and the keys, to compare
a reference implementation to the actual chip's input/output.

How will they know that the algorithm they are shown is the
algorithm in the chip ?

Is this yet another flaw in the Clipper protocols ?
We've already observed that the chip programmer can obtain 
the complete key without detection by others.
 
It seems that the features which protect thegovernment's 
interest in reading messages are very carefully designed, 
while those which protect users from cheating by the chip's 
producers are technical nonsense.

Secure protocols for key escrow and algorithm verification
exist.  Why are they not used ?  

And what is that laptop-in-a-vault ritual supposed to show ?

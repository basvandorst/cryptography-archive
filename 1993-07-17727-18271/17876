According to some LE folks, this is precisely what Digital Telephony
was/is about. Tapping anything that runs over the public network is
fairly simple, and you can (if you're the law) almost certainly find
a point of access that won't run through someone who might tell your
target. The real problem that the FBI has been complaining about is
trying to tap calls when EvilCo owns its own PBX and chunks of private
wire, especially when calls run from one extension within a single PBX
to another. The only way to do this is the dial-in tapping routine
that they claimed they weren't asking for. (Of course, it's essentially
impossible to make this work in practice because EvilCo can monitor
whatever goes out on its lines unless you build a true phone phreak's
dream come true, but that's another story...)

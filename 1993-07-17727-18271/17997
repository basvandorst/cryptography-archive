Using Kerberos or public-key to authenticate opens a whole set of issues.

If, however, you want to be able to use Kerberos to encrypt your traffic
so that it can't be read on the open internet, then you have to be even
more careful.  Regardless of US export rules and public-key patents, if
you come close to providing a general encryption service, the water just
got MUCH muddier than you probably want to deal with.  (For example, in
France you apparently have to keep all keys for "n" months in case the gov't
wants to unpack something.)

   Hey, can I make a simple request?  I understand that some flames are
inevitible on an unmoderated group, and I understand that this is really
almost the only place to talk about some of the political issues regarding
cryptology where most of the participants will know what you're talking
about.  But can you *at least* clearly mark your subject lines with some-
thing that lets me know this is a flame or a political comment, rather than
a post having to do with cryptology more directly?  Something like:
 
Subject:  David Sternlight is Faustus and the NSA is the devil
     rather than
Subject:  Re: Clipper security
 
   or
 
Subject:  Can the Feds ban DES
     rather than
Subject:  Re:  Assumptions about the NSA
 
   The recent discussions about crypto export restrictions were generally
very good about this, and I really appreciated it.  Even though I usually
wind up reading all of the posts, I'd like the option of skipping the ones
that are of no interest to me....
 
   Thanks.

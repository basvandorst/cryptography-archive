Hi

I am looking for any bench marks on any of the feautres of
secure UNIX (or for that matter - other secure OSs too).  Features
such as labeling (for networks and mandatory access), dicretionary access,
audit, object reuse , etc.

Any net direction is greatly appreciated.

Thanx many - in advance - Srini

      I don't think this is at all correct. Depending on the escrow agencies, they
      become YOUR agents, just as your bank is. Since you have prior knowledge
      that they are YOUR agents for holding keys (assuming you accept the
      voluntary Clipper deal), law enforcement still needs to serve specific
      subpoenas on your agents to get the keys.

   All right, so what's the equivalent of a numbered Swiss or Panamanian
   bank account?  Or cash?

How about a Swiss cipher?  I'm thinking of IDEA, of course.

Like Swiss bank accounts, you have to go out of your way to acquire
one..  Like a somewhat famous implementation of IDEA, it might be
illegal in some countries to "import" a bank account or "export" your
cash.

   Oh, foo.  If I don't like the regulations of a bank, I'm free to shop
   around for another bank, or to invest in a mutual fund, or to put my
   money in overseas investments.

And you are (at present) free to use other forms of encryption.  No-one
(yet) forces you to follow the flock.  Just don't expect it to be so
cheap or so convenient.

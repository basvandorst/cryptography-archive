	Gaines book is now published by Dover and is readily available
	through any local bookstore that does special orders.  I found
	the style of the book annoying and would rather recommend the
	more expensive "Elements of Cryptanalysis" by William Friedman
	(available from Aegean Park).  Very clear, lots of examples to
	work your way through and goes from Caesar to cipher machines.

	For a gentle introduction to mathematical cryptology, try the
	book by Abraham Sinkov published by the Mathematical Association of
	America.

	I really haven't been able to find one.  There are a couple of
	books about writing cryptanalytical progs. in Basic, but that is
	very different from modern machine cryptography.  Your best bet
	might be Dorothy Dennings book.  Computer cryptography is a very
	different beast from the cryptography covered in "Codebreakers."

``Export means, for purposes of this subchapter: (a) Sending or taking 
defense articles out of the United States in any manner; or (b) 
Transferring registration or control to a foreign person of any 
aircraft, vessel, or satellite on the United States Munitions List, 
whether in the United States or abroad; or (c) Sending or taking 
technical data outside of the United States in any manner except by mere 
travel outside of the United States by a person whose personal knowledge 
includes technical data; or (d) Disclosing or transferring technical 
data to a foreign person, whether in the United States or abroad; or (e) 
The performance of a defense service on behalf of, or for the benefit 
of, a foreign person, whether in the Unites States or abroad.''

I know two lawyers on opposite sides of this question. The answer is 
``maybe'' until a judge says otherwise.

Whoever is ``sending'' or ``taking'' or ``transferring'' or 
``disclosing'' or ``performing.'' Again, the final answer is up to a 
judge.

``A consipracy'' cannot be responsible for an action. Conspiracy to 
commit a crime is entirely separate from the crime itself.

I agree. However, your statement that ``U.S. Law isn't at all 
well-defined in this area'' is incorrect. It's reasonably ``well 
defined''; it's just not sufficiently well defined to handle every 
borderline case. (That's why lawyers make money.)

There is no a priori reason to assume that freedom of speech does not
include the freedom to speak in a programming language.

> And then there's the question of what "arms" are,

For the purposes of the ITAR, ``defense articles'' means anything listed
on the USML, including certain cryptographic technology. ``Arms'' are 
not defined by the ITAR.

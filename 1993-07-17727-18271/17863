   Hmmm.  Anything you do that decreases the amount that the cryptanalyst
knows about the inputs to your encryption function will help security at
least a little bit.  Thus, the PKZipping, DES and IDEA encryptions (IDEA
is the single-key encryption scheme used in PGP) will probably increase
the difficulty of an attack.  (I say "probably," because sometimes two
different encryption schemes interact badly, perhaps adding no strength
when used together.  I can't see how this would be true of DES and IDEA,
but it's conceivable it could.)  However, the UUENCODING would necessarily
weaken things, because then an attacker would know that the inputs to the
encryption function she was trying to break were restricted to a small
subset of the possible values they could take on.
 
   The general idea of multiple applications of encryption schemes, with
different keys, is pretty common these days.  A cipher that is the product
of several simpler ciphers is called a "product cipher."  DES and IDEA are
product ciphers, as are FEAL, LOKI, REDOC, and any multiple-rotor schemes
you may have heard of.

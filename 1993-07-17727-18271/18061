And in this I have to agree with you justin... I maybe one of David 
Sternlights and the NSA most implacable enemies... but DS
has done more singlehandedly to bring this discussion into the open
than anyone I can think of... in fact I worry when he shuts up...
I like his speaking out on what he believes in he tends
to motivate a huge oppostion to what he is saying...
thanks again david for your ceaseless efforts...
you really have helped me out...
     cheers

CERN is built half in France and half in Switzerland. The top grades do
have full diplomatic passports and CD plates on their cars. I have a limited
imunity that covers my actions concerned with my work at CERN with the
exception of anything to do with cars. This means that the only real perks 
are not paying income tax and being able to buy cars tax free.

Legally CERN probably could get away with using stuff without permission.
however we don't do that sort of thing and there is strict enforcement of 
policies against software theft. In the same way the health and safety laws
are in general the strictest limits applied by France/Switzerland/US. It's
a bit like limited company status theoretically you can do a lot of pretty
terrible things through a limited liability company. In effect though  
people who abuse the system get squashed...

What it does prevent however are nuisance suits and bogus attempts at extra-
territorial enforcement of patents.

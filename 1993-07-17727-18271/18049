Yup, and by hiring Walt Tuchman they get the benefit of 
all of this experience. I would think that evaluating
the quality of the cipher would be relatively easy if
it is, as I understand, a souped up version of DES. They 
be able to use all of the discussion we've had about DES
over the last x years.

Unfortunately, I think you're right about the report. Given
that the material is classified, I would guess that the report
will be Siskell and Ebert style. Thumbs up or down.

It would be good to create a list of questions that could be
asked without destroying the "black box" nature of the device.
Here is another:

*) Can line noise compromise communication security?. I've heard
that the chips will not halt if they receive a Law Enforcement Block
in the wrong format. They'll merely shift over to the key 0000...000.

Perhaps we could ask them to answer this list?

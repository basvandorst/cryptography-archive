128^5 =        3.43 E 10 potential passwords
365*24*60*60 = 3.15 E 7  seconds

Nope, your arithmetic is wrong- it works out to ~1100 crypts/second, which
is quite doable -the version of ufc-crypt that comes with Crack claims
830/second on a "DecStation" (no model specified), and the DES libraries
posted to comp.sources.misc by Eric Young last year do ~2400 crypts/second
on an IBM RS/6000 model 350.  Given this, the average time to find a
5-character password randomly picked from 128 characters would only be ~90
days.

IV.  Origins of MindWare.

-----------------------------------

Section I.  What is MindWare?

MindWare is any form of communication used to express knowledge and creativity
believed to be of value to others.  MindWare has a dual purpose.  The primary
goal of MindWare is the global distribution of quality knowledge and other
products of creativity.  Its secondary function is to assist in the financial
support of its authors, encouraging them to continue sharing their work.

MindWare is an extention of the basic ShareWare concept.  ShareWare enables
motivated and talented programmers to at least partially support themselves
in pursuing their programming interests, without the pressures of business
management, product support, or product marketing.  MindWare will provide this
ability to scientists, engineers, and anyone else who is committed to pursuing
their interests, ideas, and dreams, whatever they may be.

The concept of ShareWare grew out of the online computing community.  Many
computer programmers began creating software for themselves and their
associates.  These computer programs were often released to the public domain,
with permission given for anyone to copy and distribute.  Some of the more
useful of these programs, fueled by the rapid expansion of computer bulletin
boards (BBS's), modems, and computer networks, quickly spread internationally.

Realizing their software was useful and popular, and that they had an
opportunity to make some money with their talents and interests, many of
these programmers began requesting that a registration fee be paid by anyone
who used their software.  Permission was still given to freely copy and
distribute these programs, and nobody was going to force you to pay for
their use, the authors simply asked that you send them the registration fee
if you found their software useful.  Some even offered to send you future
releases, upgrades, or more elaborate documentation once you registered your
copy.

Section II.  Creating your own MindWare.

Creation of MindWare is easy.  Simply include with your work a request for
contributions (a specific amount is helpful), your name, a bit about yourself
and your work, and a postal mailing address.  An example is included at the
bottom of this document, feel free to experiment by sending us some cash!

MindWare can take as many forms as your imagination will allow.  Examples may
include research papers, original electronic publications, poetry, music, art,
and any software creation not normally considered ShareWare.  Any generally
accepted standard format is appropriate for use in MindWare: ASCII text,
PostScript files, GIF/JPEG images, MPEG movies, audio files, and any other
popular media formats.

Section III.  MindWare mailing lists.

listserver.  To add yourself to one or more of these mailing lists, send an

Note to readers:  It is very important to look at the `From' header of
postings in newsgroups frequented by David Sternlight.  One might
otherwise be taken in by his attempts at proof by repeated assertion.

No, sie doesn't.

Lulu argues that a specific precedent is needed before we *know* that
the PKP patents apply to PGP.

Sie explicitly disclaims - several times - the argument you attribute

The technique we see demonstrated here is known as the Straw Man
fallacy, and is one of David's favourite tactics.

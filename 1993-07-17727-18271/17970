I'm not sure what a real benchmark is, but I can tell you something about 
how fast DES and IDEA can go, based on my own timing.

These are for the encryption functions only.  No data moving. No file i/o.
Both are highly-optimized non-reentrant assembly programs.

		   DES		       IDEA
IBM XT            1,800 Byte/sec     6,300 Bytes/sec
16MHZ 286        16,000 B/s
25MHZ 386        44,000 B/s
33MHZ 486       151,000 B/s        238,000 B/s	

The DES times include the useless initial and final permutation, so if
you just want the security you can go a bit faster.  Also DES can be 
speeded up by devoting 256K to substitution tables, which I didn't do.  
Other than that, I used every trick in the book.  And then some.

These do not include the key loading time, so the times should not 
be used to predict key-search speeds.

Note that the IDEA / DES ratio is higher for the XT than the 486.  
I think this is do to slow 16 bit multiplication on the 486.

2K/Second should be no problem, unless you want DES on an XT.

The technique is called Steganography.  It is  <as some on the net like
to call it> "Security through Obscurity".  It requires a lot of overhead
to hide a relatively few bits of information for decent systems.  Once
the method is discovered, it becomes virtually worthless.  Conversely,
once a cryptosystem algoithm is discovered, it still is usable and as
strong with a new  key (ie.; Per Call Variable Triple DES).  

Very little is written about it in public as compared to conventional
cryptosystems, primarly because the people who develop and field the best
 systems do not publish them, but use them instead.  The few systems I've
seen published or suggested in open literature are generally obivious. 
The Codebreakers by Kahn has 20 or so scattered pages on some simple
steganographic implementations.  For repetitive communications in any
volume, Steganography is seldom the method of choice.

There was a very recent article in BYTE (May 1993, Peter Wayner "Should
Encryption be Regulated?", pp. 129 - 134) in which there was a partial
page discussion on hiding a message using the lsb of frames on a Kodak
CD.  The result was a 2.3 Megabyte message on a Gigabyte  CD.  
Interesting, but the scheme has problems...

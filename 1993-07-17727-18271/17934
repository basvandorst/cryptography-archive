Maybe I've just enjoyed Hitchcock movies a tad too much, but I'm
starting to get the distinct impression that DS is rather like George
Kaplan in _North by Northwest_, i.e. a cleverly maintained fictional
identity used by an intelligence agency to divert attention from the
true source of misinformation.

I just took a look at 'alt.security.pgp', and found about 15 new
messages, at least 10 of them written by this "DS".  This is not far
from the norm on a.s.pgp and also 'sci.crypt'.  And, as always,
*every* single one of "DS"s messages was a direct or indirect defence
of the NSA, or its policies -- even down to the one which claimed that
"DS" didn't support or trust the NSA "per se."  Could *any* real human
being write such a volume of disinformation on these topics, or be so
consistent an ideological prop for gov't spooks? It seems unlikely.

The only question I haven't really figured out about the "DS"
committee is who will get the movie rights to the whole story.  Does
Hitchcock (or his estate, obviously) still have a claim to the story?
Will the NSA retroactively classify my film after I make it? (Which,
btw. actually happen to Hitchcock with _Notorious_: the CIA got
*very* curious why it was Uranium in the bottles the Nazi's were
smuggling around in the film... and threatened to block distribution
of the film for revealing military secrets). And will there be a
sequel?  :-)'s for the humor impared.

Yours, Lulu...

Mike Markowitz says:

Since there is no FIPS for DSS yet, I'm not sure how you can make this
statement, assuming you're claiming a fixed prime (or small number of
primes) won't be part of the standard.  Do you know something about
the planned FIPS that we don't? If so please share it.

"While much less-than-16 round DES can be broken in seconds on a PC, I
welcome evidence that it can be done for the full 16-round DES.  I'm
unaware of results more current than than Shamir and Biham's when the
largest number of rounds for which this *had* been done was only 8."

A statement every bit as valid as yours. Yet every one in the crypto
field believes that NSA has built a practical DES search machine.

Let's not measure the capability of a government agency chartered to
do signals intercept and decipherment, with an 11-digit number of
dollars in their annual budget, by citing only what's been done and
published.

>So, yes, challenging NIST on the 512-bit limitation was reasonable;

I'd say it was more than reasonable considering the max key size went
up to 1024.

On behalf of RSA Labs, I accept your congratulations. That is, if you
meant 15ms *or less* since we can do 512 bit signature verification on
a 33mhz 486 in well under three milliseconds.  (It's actually closer
to two; 1024 bits requires less than 10 milliseconds.) The best
estimate with more optimization on a 66mhz 486 is about half a
millisecond for 512 bits.

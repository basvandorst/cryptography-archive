Those with a keen interest in cryptanalysis should make a careful 
study of David Sternlight's missives.  

If you take the least significant 2 bits from the second letter 
of the third word in each sentence an encrypted message may be 
constructed. 

This proves without a shadow of doubt that DS is a covert CIA 
communications channel.  Little wonder that the communications 
seem to be so obscure!

Thank you Detlef, Lulu, and David for your thoughtful replies.  So far the
solution which makes the most sense to me is the use of SHA to generate a
160-bit message digest, then encrypting the digest with a private key, and
decoding the digest in the laptop with a public key.  The condition which
was not clear from my initial posting was that the laptop is not in the
hands of a "trusted" person, so forging of the file by the person holding
the laptop is possible.  By using a public-key scheme, the private key can
remain in the secure-box, and the public key printed on the box label.

Then the laptop software can be public domain as well.  All the secrets will
be in the secure box.

I looked in rsa.com for a description of the public key algorithm, but did
not see anything obvious.  Can anyone  give me a good pointer??

Not hardly likely, since '100,000 Random Numbers' was produced by the
RAND Corporation -- a research and development entity spun off from
the U.S. Air Force.

Besides, if it's a listing of random numbers that's OBVIOUSLY printed
in mass quantities, there's no reason to worry.  It's the guy with a
box of typewriter paper that has random numbers typed on it in neat
columns with carbon paper that they would really like to talk to.

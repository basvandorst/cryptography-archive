   Actually, it doesn't matter.  You also have to generate and distribute
   keys under pgp as well.

Yes, but the point of RSA and other public-key systems is that you
can distribute your key *publicly* - what you have to guarantee is that
it was received accurately by the person who wants to send you mail,
and there are lots of ways to do that, while making sure that you
keep your private key secret.  With secret-key systems, like DES or IDEA,
you have to distribute the secret key so that it stay secret;
if anybody sees it they can break all your messages.

PGP creates a random session key for each message, encrypts the
message with IDEA using that session key, and encrypts the session key
using RSA so that it can be transmitted publicly along with the message.
RIPEM does about the same thing, but using DES as the secret-key system
instead of IDEA.  Later versions will probably use Triple-DES.
PGP has a better support system for key distribution.
On the other hand, using RIPEM for non-commercial use doesn't violate 
RSA's patents (in the US).  RIPEM is not legally exportable,
but it has been exported, though PGP is currently more common overseas.

In addition to the obvious security advantages of this approach over
simple use of DES or IDEA, the random session key is more likely to be
"random" than a password you made up to be easily-remembered,
like your computer account password :-), so a brute-force search of
dictionaries and short words won't find it - they have to search the
entire 2**56 or 2**128 keys, and it only gets them one message.

   Could someone throw some light on this..

A-covering: I did read the README as that is quite clearly not
export-controlled.  I didn't download any of the material in that
directory, so neither I nor rsa.com have exported any cryptographic
material from the US.

Amusing challenge:  cryptanalyse the sequence of characters following
"U.S.-only-".

     The hue and cry generated by the Clipper proposal has, at the
very least, delayed the roll out of this particular anti-privacy
program.  This has resulted in a window of opportunity for one or
more companies to provide non-escrowed alternatives and deny market
share to NSA, Inc.

     Are any such products available, soon to be available, or at
least under development?  Has the government's actions in this
arena squelched private development?

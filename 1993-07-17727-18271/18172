I suspect that some people are thinking of the Feldmeier and Karn
paper ``UNIX Password Security -- Ten Years Later'', from CRYPTO '89.
They precalculated all 4096 hashes of 107,000 different words, and
stored that on tape.

As for how fast passwords can be guessed -- using their crypt routine
on a DEC 3100, a 5-character password selected from all 128 ASCII
characters would be found in 365 days.  With a faster machine, or
several of them, even the full character set won't help you if
you use only 5 characters.

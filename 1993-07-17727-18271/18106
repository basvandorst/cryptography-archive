Lannert's proposal now resists my attack. (I can only respond to what 
people write, not what they mean.)  It still doesn't answer the question.

The security conditions for a hash function are:
1) Given a hash, one should not be able to find a message with that hash.
2) Given a message, one should not be able to find another with the same hash.
and sometimes,
3) One should not be able to find two messages with the same hash.

Can someone prove that violating 1,2 or 3 implies the ability to break
RSA ?  Even RSA falls somewhat short, since no one has proven breaking
it to be as hard as factoring the modulus.

        The one you add is the one that detected the pattern. That
        more or less answers all the other objections. In any case I
        wasn't pulling this old chestnut out of the ashes to propose
        it be used as a production engine. The series it creates are
        arguably random, but pretty predictable. I was trying to
        create a context for discussing the distinction between
        "random" and "unpredictable" and learning something in the
        process.

        Feel free to replace this method with any other that is
        detirministic but passes the strongest tests of randomness in
        a finite series. It should go without saying (but it's clear I
        have to say it anyway) that it should not be deliberately
        designed to fail a weak test of randomness at the same time.
        It's mate, which is well beyond my talents to invent, is a
        process that fails many or most tests of randomness, yet
        remains unpredictable. Or is that a contradiction?

        For the record, my contribution to the definitions is that an
        unpredictable number generator produces series such that,
        given all but a single element of an arbitrarily long
        generated series, the calculable value of the missing element
        is a nearly flat probability line across the range of possible
        values of that element. The index of cryptographic strength of
        the generator is in the precise meanings of "long" and
        "nearly". A noise source beats the spec because the elements
        are intrinsically independent.

        Cheers,
                Marc

Ahead of all: Please don't use follow-ups for flames, use mail instead
  (if you really feel the urge).

There currently are a lot of messages concerning the likes and dislikes of 
  people concerning David Sternlight. I think those discussions should take
  place in sci.psychology or someplace like that.

Other people think he is a fake.
  Please consider using alt.conspiracy.

Still other people believe in David Sternlight.
  Please use alt.religion.Davidians.

I think the current discussions have little to do with sci(ence), let alone
with a scientific approach of crypt....
  (unless, of course, you believe David Sternlight is dead.)


Please stop spilling bandwidth.

PS. I might be wrong.... If the entire discussion concerning DS is in fact a
special version of covert channel usage, then the entire discussion is all  
about cryptology.

PPS. Please, if you have to flame me, use either /dev/null or e-mail. Not news.

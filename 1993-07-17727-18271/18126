Just curious (but not enough to dig up the literature). Would a reverse
dictionary for all possible six character passwords be much shorter than
that for seven, eight, etc. character passwords?

Yes, I recognize that there are fewer six character passwords than seven,
eight, etc. but there may be some subtlety I'm not familiar with involving
hashing the plaintext with some ancillary information that would be hard to
reproduce by a cracker. If not, it would seem that one could at least use a
reverse dictionary for all possible six character passwords, and catch
anyone using such short ones quickly, yes? How quickly? What is the shortest
password (that isn't in the dictionary) that is relatively safe (say longer
than a year to crack) against brute force given current workstation
technology?

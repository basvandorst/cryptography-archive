I don't like the idea of making this a moderated group either.  However, it
occurs to me that the group could be split and one section made moderated in
the following way:

  1)  Split group into sci.crypt and sci.crypt.ds

  2)  Make sci.crypt moderated.

  3)  Make the sci.crypt moderator a program which takes posts from David
      Sternlight and redirects them to sci.crypt.ds.

David can then wibble away to his heart's content over on sci.crypt.ds and
the rest of us can learn something useful.

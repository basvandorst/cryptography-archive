One can argue that a passphrase is never testimony against yourself,
but a decrypted message is.  I doubt passphrases are constitutionally
protected, in reality or in practice.

A better way around this is using a XOR style one-time pad on whatever
messages you send out.  Two keys are automatically developed, one which
will let you read the message, and another which lets you read a 
totally different message...

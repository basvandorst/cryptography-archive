O.K. fine. Not much problem with any of that. 

So, why don't you choose OTP as your cipher system of choice?

Let's say you have twenty sites. Let's also say that those twenty sites need 
to communicate securely with each other as well as with Headquarters.

Do you choose one common keyfill (your 'OTP') for all sites? If so, how do 
you ensure, infallibly, that (1) no site will run out of key material in 
any allocated time period. (2) There will be neither inadvertent duplicate 
use of keyfill by different sites nor deliberate duplicate use at a single 
site in the belief that such a limited compromise is better than 
communication in clear?

Do you evade the above difficulties by issuing unique keyfill for each site)?
If so, how do you control and use, entirely error free and with maintenance of 
complete security, the necessary 20x20 set editions of keyfill? What if you 
are United Fruit and you require 2000x2000 set editions?

I don't say that any of the above concerns makes 'OTP' impractical for those 
who will devote the necessary thought, manpower and money into making it work
properly. I do say that they are good reasons for either using something 
other than OTP or else using it on the most restricted scale of issue.

You made a reasonable proposition. Tell us, *do* you use OTP at your sites
as your cipher system of choice or is it another case of do as I say and not 
do as I do :-) 


Pending your answer the proposition stands, that too many here spend too much time genuflecting at the shrine of OTP.

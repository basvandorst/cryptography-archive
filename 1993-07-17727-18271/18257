I'd like to do a project using IDEA encryption but need more
information on the algorithm.  Can someone please email me some good
sources, preferably those available via FTP as I have no way to access
the EUROCRYPT articles.  Source code availability would be nice, too,
I'm already studying the code in PGP.  Thanks.

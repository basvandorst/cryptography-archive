No, I mean phones being sold as new. Thre are still few or no digital phones
available, for example, in the Los Angeles area. LA Cellular, which has been
testing for over a year and had planned to have digital available this
January is still delaying--perhaps because they might decide against TDMA
and go CDMA.

Right now the situation is very uncertain. There are no CDMA/TDMA/AMPS
phones I know of. If the industry decides on CDMA, all those early adopters
of Blaupunkt TDMA whones will have worthless instruments, except for the
analog part.

What's more, since the issue is still up in the air, it looks like CDMA has
delayed digital by at least a year (at least in the LA area). If CDMA wins,
as you think likely (and as I understand it, it is technically superior in
that it offers more channels), then we have to wait for carriers to install
it, and then for a new family of phones to reach the mass market.

In any case, the statement that precipitated this thread, that "most" new
phones were "digital ready" is vacuous, since few have digital, and if
"digital ready" means they can get analog, they always could.

I agree with the statement that CDMA is probably going to be the ultimate
winner, but that wasn't what this thread was about.

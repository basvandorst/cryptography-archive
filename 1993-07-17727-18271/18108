Has anyone done a word frequency analysis on all the words posted 

by David Sternlight?  This might settle some of the paranoia 

regarding his identity. 

 

Otherwise there will always be two factions - those who dislike 

his contributions and those who, to use a naval expression, think 

the sun shines out of his porthole.

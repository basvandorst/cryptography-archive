If you do go with the Soundblaster, perhaps a reversed biased 
transistor junction breakdown as a noise source for the card.
And remember to keep the sample rate low enough to cut down on
correlations  -- I would suggest no more than 1/10 the overall
noise bandwidth.  (Gee -- with the Soundblaster you could run
a Fast Fourier transform on the data -- no spectrum analyzer needed)
And if you want to get real computationally fancy, digital filtering
to eliminate the 60 Hz component.

The tired argument that it will take a court decision to "de-confirm" the
validity of the PKP patents has been around in David Sternlighter's postings
for at least a year to my knowledge, and has been refuted for as long
by various writers here. Perhaps DS would like to move on to more useful
pursuits, such as helping to code a RSAREF-compliant U.S. version of PGP.

BTW, I believe that DS is an employee of PKP, not the NSA, although the
difference may be moot.

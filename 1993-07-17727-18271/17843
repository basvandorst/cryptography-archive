Your cost estimates are probably not far wrong. And in a market as
competitive as cellular phones, what makes you think that the
manufacturers will gladly consent to this added cost, when most could
easily have provided good encryption purely in software using spare
CPU cycles, for ZERO additional manufacturing cost per unit?  Believe
me, I've seen some pretty bloody battles over parts costing *much*
less than $25.  Even pennies count in the mass consumer market.

They might be more expensive initially, but the assumption has always
been that there's little point in going digital unless the price of
the new phones can eventually be brought down to the level of present
analog phones. This is entirely feasible with our stuff -- if you let
us continue to refine *all* of the technology that goes into it.

Face it, tying the entire future of your product to an expensive,
sole-sourced chip like Clipper -- produced by a company beholden
solely to the spooks, who guarantee them an absolute monopoly -- would
be utter financial suicide.

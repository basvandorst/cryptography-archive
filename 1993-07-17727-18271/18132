Ah, Dick ...

The current phase of the Permanent Floating Flamefest (SRIA, of course!)
concerns whether or not the ballot taker cooked the books, so to speak,
by discarding "no" votes.  Certainly a ballot taker who phonies the raw
votes can phoney the ballot-server's numbering system; and anyone claiming
that the ballot taker phonied the raw votes can claim that the numbering
was phonied as well.


OTOH, putting the ballot taker's public key in the CFV means that anyone
who cares can validate any purported vote ack.  The only danger would
be if somebody found and released the ballot taker's *private* key ...
although I guess that might be grounds for scrapping the vote.

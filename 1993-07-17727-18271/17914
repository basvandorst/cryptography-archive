Hi,

You weren't thinking of using a "free for personal and educational

commercial use,   
were you :-)

No, I wasn't!  I mailed the author, and he said that it's *free* for
use (this was 2.1 - apologies if the terms have changed).  However,
if we *do* use it, I will insist that we pay him the $100/copy figure
that he said he'd charge if it were commercial.

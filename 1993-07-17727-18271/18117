The rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated.

There is a group called alt.fan.david-sternlight. Since the noise and
personal attack level there has gotten out of hand, I don't read it, but
anti-DS co-religionists may self-congratulate each other there. The group
was originally created by some wise-guy who did it via clandestine means,
not by me.

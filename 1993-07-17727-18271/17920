"I" have. Robinson's statement is completely consistent with what I
heard in person from Dan Cook at the CPSR meeting, which was that
Treasury does have jurisdiction over the permanent import of
cryptographic software, but they currently do not exercise it. In
other words, the permanent import of cryptographic software is not
restricted in any way.

I do hope this settles the issue.

   One interesting development with recent OS's is the advent of shared
   libraries.  Surffice it to say, it is quite trivial to change crypt()
   to whatever algorithm you like and modify getpass() so that passwords
   longer that 8 characters are returned (well it is under sunOS anyway :-).

   If you want to use MD5, you can,
   since any program that ever called crypt() all call the new version in the
   shared library.  You may have problems with programs that expect
   to get back 13 characters from crypt().

It's not as trivial as it looks - if you're only concerned about
single machines, then changing the shared library fixes almost everything
(watch out for special cases like boot-time passwords),
and programs you mentioned that "know" crypt takes 8-character input
and produces 13-character output, but if you're doing anything
between machines, such as NIS*, you need to update all the machines,
which may be interesting for that 386i sitting in the back corner
or your terminal server box :-)

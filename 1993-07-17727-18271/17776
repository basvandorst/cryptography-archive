Have you ever read FIPS PUB-46?  The DES document from NBS?  It refers to
the key as being 64 bits.  Everywhere.  You have to decipher :-) their
rambling publication and examine the algorithm within before you discover
that the entire 768 bit key schedule is derived only from 56 of the key
bits; the remaining 8 bits are discarded as "parity" bits.  Hell, a
Hamming ERCC code would only take 6 bits and that has error _correction_.
I'm too lazy to check, but I'll wager that if one were to examine NSA's
closed testimony to congress about the DES scandal, you'd hear them 
referring to cutting the Lucifer key from 128 bits only down to 64 bits.
Bad, but not nearly as bad as 56 bits.  Talk about disinformation.

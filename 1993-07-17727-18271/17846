Actually, it's worse than that.  If you're involved in multi-million dollar  
espionage, you're not likely to talk about it with someone you never even met  
claiming to be a journalist.  With a Washington address, no less. No point in  
trusting a channel if you can't trust the person on the other end.

You can talk MIPS, MFLOPS, feature points and cyclomatic complexity all day  
long.  The only metric that matters is Return on Investment.

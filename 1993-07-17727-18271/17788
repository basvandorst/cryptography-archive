No, in systems like Andrew Hume's "File Motel", files check in and
they don't check out.  This is one of the desirable features of WORM;
it's also one of the undesirable features, since it's more
space-consuming that rewritable, but you DO know you can't lose, or erase, 
anything you've stored there.

You could always steal the disk and sandblast it:-)

Vesselin continues to show both his personal civility and his respect for
net resources with the above. 

Just before this, he complained that I had asked a simple arithmetical
question I should have been able to answer myself. My question was followed
by an extensive thread by others presenting one or another calculation and
disputing each other. I guess Vesselin is not only smarter than I am, but
smarter than many other experts here.

It's good that someone of such civility and wisdom takes a free hand with
net resources to help the rest of us, who would otherwise be doomed to live
in ignorance.

Ross Anderson posts an explanation of how the Clipper chip is protected. As
an amateur electrical engineer (I minored in the stuff at MIT), I'm impressed
that NSA has done their homework so cleverly ahd thoroughly, though I've
assumed I was getting professional value for my tax dollars.

If the algorithm reflects the same degree of cleverness, I think there's
little to fear (beyond key compromise) with respect to Clipper security
against the adversaries it was designed to frustrate.

Maybe I should swallow hard and pay the $2400 AT&T wants for a pair of boxes
before all the screaming gets it either weakened or taken off the market.

Sure, with a Pentium or Pentagon Chip you can do DSS real fast.
If it takes half a second on a 486, it's likely to take 10-30 seconds on an
8086-relative like an HP 95 Palmtop, and noticeably longer on a Sharp
Wizard or competitor, or on a cheap non-memory-rich smartcard like you
might want to use for a telephone credit card or subway or tollbooth token.

Even RSA is too slow on the slower ones of those, and the issue
of precomputation that Jim brought up is especially a concern for smartcards.

The government once contended that having validation slower than
signing was a *feature*; I guess they expect most signed messages
never to be validated, and few to be validated more than once :-)
I'd expect that, if anything, signatures would be more likely to be
done on machines that are powerful enough to generate something you
want signed, while many of the uses for validation include wimpy machines
which are just making sure something's ok.  Additionally, for signing
documents, many of them will have multiple recipients, but one sender.

On the other hand, RSA *does* have a vested interest in making their
product sound better :-)  But in this case they seem to be right.

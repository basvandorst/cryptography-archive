Many people have observed this, and it is a bit surprizing that the
"New Directions" paper didn't suggest this mode of use.  I believe
the first to publish this idea was T. ElGamal in "A Public Key
Cryptosystem and a Signature Scheme Based on Discreet Logarithms",
IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, v. IT-31, n.4,
1985 pp469-472.  He actually suggested a DH key for each block,
but the concept is the same.

Another observation, which I have not heard pointed out, is
that the keys for the Digital Signature Standard will be very
very much the same: the key pair (g^x,g) along with the modulus N.
The only difference is that g is not a  generator for the group 
in NIST's system (does this weaken it ?).  So while the DSS can not 
itself be used for encryption, it seems the key distribution and 
certification system can.

Adoption and implementation of the Digital Signature Standard would
require an officially blessed "cryptographic infrastructure", along
with standards for certificates and keys, and all that.

We might want to work on an unofficial standard for using DSS keys 
for encryption, since key distribution seems to be the hardest part 
of actually implementing public key cryptolography for the masses.  

PKP patents would still apply, since they hold the rights to both the 
Diffie-Hellman and ElGamal/Schnorr systems.

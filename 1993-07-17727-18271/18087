Suppose you give me a two block message  B1,B2  and your one block
RSA() function. 

I choose an arbitrary C1, and choose C2 so that:
                        C2= RSA(C1) xor RSA(B1) xor B2. 

now       RSA(C1) xor C2  =  RSA(C1) xor RSA(C1) xor RSA(B1) xor B2
                          =                          RSA(B1) xor B2

so  RSA( RSA(C1) xor C2 ) = RSA( RSA(B1) xor B2 )
thus    my message's hash = your message's hash. 


It's easy to miss things like this, but I think the origion question
was asking for a hash which could be proven to be secure given some
assumption.  Always be suspicious until you have the proof.

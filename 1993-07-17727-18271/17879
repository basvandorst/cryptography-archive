I am in the need of a serial number algorithm which would be secure to
hackers reverse engineering the workstation software.  I have figured out
a way but the resulting string is way too big for our small serial number.

A) Take the serial number and run a hash algorithm on it for 64/128/256 bits
B) Encrypt the hash result with a private key
C) make the serial number as 'serial number' and append the encrypted
   hash result.

The workstation software will hash the serial number and check that against
the decrypted hash using the public key.

Any comments?  Better approaches.  Even if I used base 64 with lots of
strange characters it is pretty hard to reduce this to say 10-20 characters.

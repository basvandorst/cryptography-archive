Perhaps someone could devise some sort of "Turing Test" for D.S. What
criteria could one use to objectively test the hypothesis that D.S. is an NSA
plant? One that seems to be out would be humorous self-deprecation ... a very
recent posting by "David Sternlight" seems to rule that out? Moreover, it
would appear to already be proven that a bureaucratic committee masquerading
as an individual would succumb to the temptation to want to appear to be very
clever .... all in all, an interesting quandary, eh?

Tschuess!

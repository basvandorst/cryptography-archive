Well, let's just ask him?  If he is, and the NSA has any type of restrictions like the OSI does in the Air Force, then he'd have to either tell us, or answer in a non-committal way.  If he says no, and he is, then possibly use information by any post here to imprison someone, then it's entrapment.

     So Mr. David Sternlight, if that is your real name, are you an agent for the NSA or any other law enforcement agency?

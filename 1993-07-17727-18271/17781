Has there been much work done with recursive algorithms?  This could be
done several ways, to either encrypt the encrypted data many times on
itself, or else make some kind of active algorithm which modifies itself
after each process...  The idea would be to encrypt your text many times
over, so that in order to crack it you'd have to get past the first
encryption before the second (and you'd have virtually no way of telling)
and so on, maybe a hundred times over for especially sensitive stuff. 
It's amazing what can really be done with cryptography considering the lack
of imagination that seems to be out there...  Maybe governments hire too
many dull -- predictable -- mathematicians...

Instead of having a traditional "key", then, it would be a "padlock"
encryption, with a few hundred keys that must be turned in sequence.  I
bet a recursive-style encryption scheme would be virtually uncrackable,
even by the big machines.  At this level, though, I wonder if governments
just resort to "blue-collar" techniques of getting the data (confiscating
the equipment, the person, arranging for an 'accident', or whatever). 
There was an interesting article run in a recent Byte magazine which
suggests to me that the NSA and FBI are anxious about being able to crack
whatever encryption schemes are out there...

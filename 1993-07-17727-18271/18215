1. I have applied for two licenses, using exactly the form letters I
posted, as per the advice of a NIST lawyer. I don't imagine NIST will 
make any decisions until at least mid-August.

2. Who cares? It's free, and it helps stop the NIST-PKP giveaway. Why 
don't you just try it? You could easily succeed!

That depends on what you mean by ``commercial user.'' If you apply for 
and obtain an unrestricted individual license to use DSA, then the fact
that you might use DSA at work, or to communicate with other businesses,
is irrelevant.

However, an individual license won't let you sublicense other people to
use DSA. So you can't sell a DSA implementation without a commercial
license.

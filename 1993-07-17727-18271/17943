          ^^^^^^^^^

"David Sternlight" posts this thankfully short message in which they
(I say 'they' under the assumption previously mentioned that 'DS' is a
NSA committee) seems not even to understand the meaning of the word
'precedent'.  As I've mentioned in agreement with DS, *of course* a
patent is valid unless overturned.  Everyone on this group knows that.
The question DS keeps trying to obfuscate is that of the extent of
*application* of PKP patents, which are not determined within the
patents themselves (and claims by Jim Bizdos are simply not relevant
to this scope, only rulings by judges are so relevant).

Let's do a little thought experiment:  Although I do not have the
honor of owning any patents, I do have some copyrighted material which
I have written on various occassions.  Thus, I hereby *claim* that the
last ten posts by DS to sci.crypt are in violation of my copyrights.
And further, I ask him to cease and desist in such plagiarism -- and
ask him (them) to pay me reperations for lost earnings on said
copyrighted material.  There! Did that feel good? I've made a *claim*
that DS violated a copyright held by me.  Like patents, copyrights are
presumptively valid unless overturned.  However, it just might be
possible that my copyrights could be *upheld* (i.e. they really were
on original writing), and yet not be held to *apply* to DS's posts (by
virtue of the fact that DS expresses different ideas with different
words, for example).  Is there any *precedent* on the question of DS's
violations of my copyrights? Well, simply put, no! There is only
precedent if a judge has previously ruled on the scope of application
of my particular copyrights -- if one had, such *precedent* could, in
principle, be introduced into my case against DS; though it would not,
of course, *determine* the outcome of such case by itself.

Let's help DS out:
	Precedent:  An instance, case, or decision that may serve
	as an example or justification for a later similar one.
A good legal dictionary will give a more precise definition of the
*legal* meaning, but this certainly suffices to show that a *patent*
is not a *precedent*.

Yours, Lulu (who, incidentally, loves the he/she/it thing above).

The blue-ribbon panel, consisting of Dorothy Denning of Georgetown, Ernest
Brickell of Sandia, Stephen Kent of BBN, David Maher of AT&T, and Walter
Tuchman of Amperif Corp., reported yesterday that (I'm quoting from the 
Georgetown press release)
1) There is no significant risk that Skipjack can be broken in 
   the next 30-40 years by exhaustive search.
2) There is no significant risk that Skipjack can be broken by
a shortcut attack and
3) The strength of Skipjack does not depend on the classification of the
   algorithm.

In light of the report, NIST today promulgated Clipper/Skipjack as a voluntary 
standard.

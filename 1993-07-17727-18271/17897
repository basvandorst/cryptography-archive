   Not to be argumentative, but to get at the facts:

   Tariffs aren't the only way the Treasury Department has of preventing
   imports. They can simply put an item on the Munitions List and prohibit its
   import.

   Thus I think you need to do a bit more homework.

According to communique's I've had, crypto is NOT on the Treasury
Dept's Munitions list....

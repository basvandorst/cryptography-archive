In retrospect, perhaps it should have been guessed that NSA wouldn't put
a back door into DES that would allow it to be broken trivially for
fear that someone would stumble across it.  Perhaps they would if they
found a way to make it computationally infeasable to find the
information about the cypher that allows the trivial break, but as far
as I know neither cryptography nor theoretical computer science outside
the NSA are anywhere near being able to design such a cypher, even one
where the backdoor mechanism is obvious.  I suspect that in every aspect
except key size they wanted DES to be as strong as possible so that
no-one without access to their massive computing resources could crack
it.

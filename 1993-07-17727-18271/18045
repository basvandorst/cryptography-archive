Summary: How secure if Diffie-Hellman used as a public key encryption system?
Keywords: DH Diffie-Hellman Public Key

It is well known that Diffie-Hellman key exchange can form the basis
for a simple form of public-key cryptography.

Alice's Diffie-Hellman "public key" would be the pair (g^x, g), where
g is a generator of the group and x is secret.  If Bob wants to send
the message M to her, he chooses a random y and calculates g^(xy) to
use as the key for a conventional algorithm like DES.  He gets
C = DES(g^(xy), M), and sends Alice (g^y, C).  Alice calculates g^(xy)
uses it to DES-decrypt C, getting M.

What are the pros and cons of this technique, compared to RSA?  Are
there any security weaknesses in re-using the same g^x value for many
messages?

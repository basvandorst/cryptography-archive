Nothing wrong with multiple encryption in general, as long as you stick to
the usual guidelines about key selection.  Putting them together this way
hurts your security rather than helping it, though.  At each of the second
two steps the uuencoding introduces known elements in the plaintext: a
standard header and trailer, and "<newline>M" sequences at predictable
intervals, as well as providing a recognizable restricted plaintext
alphabet.  Survey says: <bzzt>.

That's independent of the fact that no practical cracks have been
published for IDEA, DES, or even PKZIP separately (the differential
cryptanalysis break on DES is interesting and important, but doesn't bring
it into the range of brute force for the average customer).

The naive user of a package designed like this would probably use the
same password for all N encryptions, so that breaking the final Phillips
cipher would yield the key needed for unwinding the rest of it!

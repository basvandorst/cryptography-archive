I have seen references in this news group of another newsgroup called
alt.privacy.clipper.  Is this a real news group???  If it is my machine
doesn't seem to get it.  If it's real, I can get our news administrator
to subscribe to it.  Is there anything we need to know to do this??

I have been reviewing  various clipper related articles in sci.crypt
with some interest and I'm curious as to what articles are posted in
alt.privacy.clipper that weren't in sci.crypt??

thanx

roger

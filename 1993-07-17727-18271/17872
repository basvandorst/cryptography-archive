I think this is a point that William Murray has been making.
Customers are already doing so many complex things with leased lines
in private networks that any attempt to mandate "wiretappability"
(either with the Digital Telephony Initiative or with Clipper) would
perhaps do even more damage to them than to the public networks that
have gotten most of the attention to date.

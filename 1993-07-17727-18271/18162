Kahn has a description of a beautiful WWII-vintage example of this
technique.  A military crypto-guy managed to get a message something
like: "The Queen Elizabeth sails from Halifax, Nova Scotia, tonight"
broadcast on a radio show by subtly manipulating an interview with some
celebrity.  Only those let into the secret beforehand realized the
message had been transmitted.

The French intelligence agencies did, didn't they?  I seem to remember that
the minister in charge announced it at a press conference or somesuch (some
boast about a $1b deal which was obtained via espionage - I can't find the 
exact text online at the moment).
 
In addition there's things like:
 
                            STATEMENT OF 
                          RAYMOND G. KAMMER
   ACTING DIRECTOR, NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY
 
[...]
 
Additionally, I have grown convinced, through strong anecdotal
evidence, most of it shared on a proprietary basis, of the growing
threat to American business from "economic espionage."  Much has been
reported in the press of the activities of foreign intelligence
services targeting American firms, and sharing their findings with
competing foreign firms.  I am convinced that American firms need
strong security, and in particular, strong cryptography, to protect
against such threats.  
 
Peter.

You are, of course, right. I didn't include the control characters,
because I have never seen anybody actually using them - while in the
same time many people do use both upper-, lower-case letter, digits and
punctuation characters.

But you also have to store the salt, which is 1.5 bytes. Actually, I
made a different mistake; here is where the number 9 came from. I
(incorrectly) assumed that the result of the encryption is 56-bit (7
bytes), plus 1.5 bytes salt this is 8.5 bytes, or approximately 9
bytes.

But I think that the original poster was concerned only about the
security of one particular password (presumably his password); not
about the general possibility to break into any account of the machine
he is using. And he also asked about shorter passwords. I still think
that it is computationally infeasible to crack a 5-character really
random password.

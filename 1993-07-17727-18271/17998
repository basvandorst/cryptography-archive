(Support talk.politics.crypto! That's where this belongs.)

William B. Robinson, Director of the Office of Defense Trade Controls, 
told me in a telephone call today that ITAR, the International Traffic 
in Arms Regulations, will be revised in 10 days. Presumably the revised
version will be called DTR, the Defense Trade Regulations, and will look 
very much like the regulations proposed last year. It will be available
from the Government Printing Office.

It is not yet clear whether the new regulations will do anything to 
improve the crypto export situation. My guess is that they will not.

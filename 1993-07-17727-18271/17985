So that leads one to ask the next obvious question: what is
Sternlight's middle name?  If it's "Edward" or "Elliot" or any other
'E' name, that makes him 'DES,' which would be a dead give-away that
he is a collective effort of some NSA folks...But one would assume
that the NSA guys would be smarter than that, right....?

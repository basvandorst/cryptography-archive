Given the fact that (as noted in Karn, etc. al.) 100K+ passwords can be
precomputed, consider that the load (and the resulting database) could be
spread out over a network of machines.  Given a network of cooperating,
say, SPARC 1's, the task of precomputing a decently large subset of Gene's
computed password universe would be almost trivial.

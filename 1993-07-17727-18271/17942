   I just took a look at 'alt.security.pgp', and found about 15 new
   messages, at least 10 of them written by this "DS".  This is not far
   from the norm on a.s.pgp and also 'sci.crypt'.  And, as always,
   *every* single one of "DS"s messages was a direct or indirect defence
   of the NSA, or its policies -- even down to the one which claimed that
   "DS" didn't support or trust the NSA "per se."  Could *any* real human
   being write such a volume of disinformation on these topics, or be so
   consistent an ideological prop for gov't spooks? It seems unlikely.

DS has occasionally posted articles with opinions that agree with the 
Good Guys, like opposing bans on non-Clipper encryption
(unlike Dorothy Denning, who is more consistently pro-government-power,
though perhaps more skeptical about government itself.)

You just don't understand the Liberal and Conservative mindsets,
which think Government knows what it's doing and is trying to
help society in some way or other - there really *are* people
who believe that sort of thing.  Most of them vote for the
Democrats and Republicans ....

Now, if this were alt.conspiracy, I'd say something like 
	"but the occasional inconsistency is put there to fool you,
	which just demonstrates how clever they are"  :-)

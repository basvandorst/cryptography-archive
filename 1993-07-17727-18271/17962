   Sure.  Fast enough to be implemented in software on a 386SX/16 and
   encrypt at 2k/second with plenty of time left over for the voice
   compression.  AFAIK, none of the cyphers considered to be really strong
   go that fast, and all we have left to trade in for speed is security,
   so the cypher is weakened to make it fast enough.

Is even "cat" fast enough to leave you "plenty of time left over for voice
compression" on a 386SX/16?  Can't get much less secure than that :-)
You're not likely to do CELP with the leftovers, though maybe ADPCM will fit.

On the other hand, if a 30 MIPS Sun can do DES at 200 KB/s, a 3 MIPS
386 ought to be able to do close to 20 KB/s, so 2KB/s ought to burn
about 10-20% of its capacity, subject to the accuracy of MIPS...
Has anybody done any real benchmarks on wimpy Intel boxes?

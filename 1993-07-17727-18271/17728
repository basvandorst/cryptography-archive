The recipient of the message could (if he or she wants so; I'm not going 
to indulge in the legal argument) present the session key (if they hack 
PGP, for instance, to write the key to stdout). It's verifiable in two 
ways: 

- If it can be used to decrypt the message into cleartext, it is extremely 
  improbable that this cleartext is different from the `real' one produced 
  with a different key. IDEA and DES do not provide, as far as I know and 
  has been discussed in these groups, any such means of steganography. 

- The session key can be RSA-encrypted with the recipient's public key; if 
  the result matches the encrypted key inside the original message, the 
  key is authentic.

Signing of messages would not work if disclosure of a session key could 
compromise the secret key.

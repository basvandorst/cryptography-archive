"The power to tax is the power to destroy,"  -- John Marshall

But, back to the real problem...

I would love to give the MBTI test to some of the folks in this thread...

Functional definition:  If things are confused [just assume] and no one
bothers to stop you from doing it, functionally, it's legal.

Some personalities will have problems with that definition.  I just hope
those kinds of folks don't ever have to run a real business or other 
major enterprise ;)

An easy solution to the "how do we know if we've found the right
plaintext" problem is simply to run a test for randmomness over the
plaintext, using say, a Chi^2 test.  Since I have neither the time nor
the computing resources to try a brute force of any strong cipher, I
don't know what the results would be of such an excercise.  My guess
would be a lot of false keys would turn up complete garbage, while a
very few would have a high enough level of positive entropy to merit
human examination.

My 2 cents for today.

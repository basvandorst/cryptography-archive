While we're on this subject, I wondered whether anything of this sort
can be done with a WORM (write once, read many) storage device, such
as a writable optical disk.  From what I have heard, the huge capacity
of such medium means that it is possible to simply supersede old files
by using a higher version number instead of deleting the old file.
Old versions of the data remain on the disk forever, but the OS
ignores the old versions and the user sees only the latest one.  To
the user, the old file has disappeared, and yet the fact that the data
cannot physically be over-written means that someone could scrounge
through old files with relative ease.

Is there a simple way to ensure private deletion of such old files,
without resorting to cryptography?

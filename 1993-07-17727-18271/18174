	One thing that _should_ be enforced on all systems is the 
	"8 characters, two of which must be a !#@$!$%, number, or
	space" password format.

	I remember reading a list of "common" passwords in a book called
	something like, "Worms, Viruses and Trojan Horses"--anyone have

    The 21st century begins at 12:00:00 on 1/1/2001.  The proper date for new
    millenium parties is 31/12/2000, not 31/12/1999.  Years are cardinal
    numbers.  2000+1=2001.  New, creative counting schemes need not apply.

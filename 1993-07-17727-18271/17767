I've heard rumors about this sort of thing before.  I'm sure that at
some level, there still is record of what was previously written on
the disk.  Presumably that's why the people who REALLY care about
secrecy destroy the media.  I've never heard of a commercial product
that does this, though.

I bet I could make it very difficult to recover a file even by this
method.  I could overwrite the file several times, so that the signal
of the original data is mixed with the signal of the data I just wrote
and erased.  I could create a new file with the same name as the old
file (and then delete that too), so that chances are there is no
record of which disk blocks the original file used.  I could first
rename the original file to something uninteresting ("core", or
"fractal_pict.bin", for example), so that it is not obvious what files
were there to begin with.

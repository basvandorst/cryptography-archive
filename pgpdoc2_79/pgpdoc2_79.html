<H1>where to get PGP</H1>
<P>The following describes how to get the freeware public key
cryptographic software PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) from an anonymous
FTP site on Internet, or from other sources.  
<P>PGP has become a worldwide de facto standard for E-mail encryption.
PGP has sophisticated key management, an RSA/conventional hybrid 
encryption scheme, message digests for digital signatures, data
compression before encryption, and good ergonomic design.  PGP is
well featured and fast, and has excellent user documentation.  Source
code is free.
<P>The Massachusetts Institute of Technology is the distributor of PGP
version 2.6, for distribution in the USA only.  It is available from
<I>net-dist.mit.edu</I>, a controlled FTP site that has restrictions and
limitations, similar to those used by RSA Data Security, Inc., to comply
with export control requirements.  The software resides in the directory
/pub/PGP.
<P>A reminder:  Set mode to binary or image when doing an FTP transfer.
And when doing a kermit download to your PC, specify 8-bit binary
mode at both ends.
<P>There are two compressed archive files in the standard release, with
the file name derived from the release version number.  For PGP
version 2.6.2, you must get pgp262.zip which contains the MSDOS
binary executable and the PGP User's Guide, and you can optionally
get pgp262s.zip which contains all the source code.  These files can
be decompressed with the MSDOS shareware archive decompression
utility PKUNZIP.EXE, version 1.10 or later.  For Unix users who lack
an implementation of UNZIP, the source code can also be found in the
compressed tar file pgp262s.tar.Z.
<P>If you don't have any local BBS phone numbers handy, here is a BBS
you might try.  The Catacombs BBS, operated by Mike Johnson in
Longmont, Colorado, has PGP available for download by people in the US
or Canada only.  The BBS phone number is 303-772-1062.  Mike
Johnson's voice phone number is 303 772-1773, and his E-mail address
is mpj@csn.org.  Mike also has PGP available on an Internet FTP site
for users in the US or Canada only; the site name is csn.org, in
directory /mpj/, and you must read the README.MPJ file to get it.
<P>To get a fully licensed version of PGP for use in the USA or Canada,
contact ViaCrypt in Phoenix, Arizona.  Their phone number is
602-944-0773.  ViaCrypt has obtained all the necessary licenses from
PKP, Ascom-Tech AG, and Philip Zimmermann to sell PGP for use in
commercial or Government environments.  ViaCrypt PGP is every bit as
secure as the freeware PGP, and is entirely compatible in both
directions with the freeware version of PGP.  ViaCrypt PGP is the
perfect way to get a fully licensed version of PGP into your
corporate or Government environment.
<P>Here are a few people and their E-mail addresses or phone numbers you
can contact in some countries to get information on local PGP 
availability for versions earlier than 2.5:

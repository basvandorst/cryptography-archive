[Instructions on how to get RIPEM - Riordan's Privacy Enhanced Mail]


To access the cryptographic archive at rpub.cl.msu.edu, 
you must have an "account" on my custom FTP server.  Traditional
anonymous FTP login is allowed, but anonymous users are restricted
from doing GETs on files containing significant crypto software.

To apply for FTP access to rpub.cl.msu.edu, send an email message
to ripem@rpub.cl.msu.edu.   State your citizenship (must be USA
or Canadian) and your willingness to comply with relevant export
laws and software licenses.  Also state the "canonical" Internet
domain name of your host.  (If you are not sure of the primary 
name of your host, FTP to rpub.cl.msu.edu under user anonymous.
The FTP server will inform you of your hostname.)  Also state 
the country in which your host resides.

Here's a sample email message you might send to ripem@rpub.cl.msu.edu:

   Dear Mark,

   Please give me access to rpub.cl.msu.edu.  I am an American
   citizen, and I agree to comply with crypto export laws and
   RSAREF license terms.  My hostname is hobbit.egr.bigu.edu;
   this host is located in the United States.

   Thank you.

When I receive your message, with luck I'll promptly issue you
a special FTP username and password by return email.  This username 
will work only from the hostname you specify in your message.

Frankly, it pains me to have to go through these shenanigans,
but my perhaps overly conservative interpretation of USA export
laws prompts me to do so.  I don't want to have the site shut
down for non-compliance.

One advantage of this admittedly restrictive access policy is that
I now feel more comfortable in putting more of my crypto archives
online.  Over time I hope to build a rather substantial collection
here.

Thank you for your patience,

Mark Riordan   mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu

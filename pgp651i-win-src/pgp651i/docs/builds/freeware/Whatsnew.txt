NEW FEATURES IN 6.5.1

1.  PGPnet. PGPnet is a landmark product in the
    history of PGP. PGPnet secures all TCP/IP
    communications between itself and any other
    machine running PGPnet. PGPnet has 
    been successfully tested with Cisco routers 
    (requires Cisco IOS 12.0(5) or later with 
    IPSec TripleDES), Linux FreeS/WAN, and many 
    others. 

2.  Self-Decrypting Archives. You may now encrypt
    files or folders into Self-Decrypting Archives
    (SDA) which can be used by users who do not even
    have PGP. The archives are completely independent
    of any application, compressed and protected by
    PGP's strong cryptography.

3.  Integrated PGP Command Line. This version
    incorporates the popular command line version of
    PGP for Windows platforms. This product provides
    you a convenient way to integrate PGP with
    other Windows applications and automated processes
    on your desktop system. Please note that this 
    is intended for single user/workstation use. For 
    use on servers, customers are required to purchase 
    the PGP Command Line/Batch Server product. Please 
    contact your local Network Associates Sales
    representative for more information.

4.  Automated Freespace Wiping. PGP's Freespace Wipe
    feature now allows you to use the Windows Task
    Scheduler to schedule periodic secure wiping 
    of the freespace on your disk.

5.  Hotkeys. The Use Current Window feature has been
    significantly enhanced by the addition of Hotkeys.
    By pressing the configured key combination, the
    Encrypt/Decrypt/Sign functions can be 
    automatically invoked in zero clicks without 
    using PGPtray.

6.  Fingerprint Word List. When verifying a PGP public
    key fingerprint, you can now choose to view the
    fingerprint as a word list instead of hexadecimal
    characters. The word list in the fingerprint text
    box is made up of special authentication words that
    PGP uses and are carefully selected to be phonetically
    distinct and easy to understand without phonetic
    ambiguity.

7.  Support for Outlook 2000 and Outlook Express 5.0.
    This version of PGP adds support for sending and 
    receiving encrypted e-mail in Microsoft Outlook 2000 
    and Outlook Express 5.0.

8.  HTTP Proxy Support. If you are behind a corporate
    firewall with an HTTP proxy server, PGP now supports
    accessing HTTP keyservers through the proxy.  To use
    this feature, you must configure the proxy server
    address in your Internet Explorer preferences.

9.  Smart Word Wrapping. The word wrapping in PGP now
    automatically rewraps paragraphs and even quoted
    paragraphs resulting in much cleaner signed messages.

To install PGP on a Windows 95, 98, or NT system,
you must have:

- Windows 95, 98, or NT 4.0 with Service Pack 3/4/5
- 32 MB RAM
- 16 MB hard disk space for the Client install

If you plan to run PGPnet on the system, you must 
also have:

users of Windows 95a (the original release of
Windows 95). PGPnet supports Windows 95b (OSR2),
Windows 98 and Windows NT 4.0.

KNOWN ISSUES

*PGP ISSUES*

1.  The maximum size for RSA keys is 2048 bits. This
    is due to limitations in the RSA libraries and 
    our desire to remain backward-compatible with 
    previous versions of PGP. (Some previous versions 
    of PGP did function with large RSA keys, but 
    creation of these keys has never been supported.)

2.  Mismatching your keyring files can result in 
    data loss. Your public keyring file and private 
    keyring file must be kept in sync.  If, for 
    instance, you select a public keyring file that
    does not contain the public portion of your 
    private key and do not also change the private 
    keyring to the corresponding file, you and 
    others will not be able to encrypt to exported 
    versions of your key after that time. In most 
    cases, simply updating your key from a public 
    copy on a keyserver will fix this.  However, it 
    is recommended that the keyring files always be
    kept in sync. A future version is expected 
    to correct this issue.

3.  Some PGP Versions 6.0 and later features are 
    incompatible with previous versions of PGP, so 
    we feature a "compatible" export format that 
    strips incompatible features such as Photo IDs 
    and X.509 certificates from keys. Selecting 
    "Include 6.X Extensions" in the Export dialog 
    enables these features to be exported. By 
    default, we export in compatible mode. You 
    may change the default in the Advanced 
    preferences dialog. When sending a key to a 
    PGP Certificate Server Version 2.0 or above, 
    Photo IDs always accompany the key. The default 
    LDAP server in PGP 6.x supports this.

4.  On Windows 95/98, the Free Space Wiper will 
    reset every time another program writes to your 
    disk while the wiping process is in progress. 
    This is similar to defragmentation programs, 
    and is required by the Operating System. For 
    optimal wiping, make sure to close all open 
    applications. On some systems with very low 
    amounts of RAM, it may be advisable to also
    shutdown Windows Explorer.

5.  The Windows Explorer provides PGP with 
    information only about the target of a shortcut 
    and not the shortcut itself. If you use the 
    Wipe feature in the Explorer, the shortcut 
    itself will not be wiped. The actual target 
    will be wiped. When using PGPtools, the shortcut 
    will also be wiped.

6.  Hotkeys are for use with applications that 
    support general text editing. Using Hotkeys 
    with some applications may result in 
    unpredictable behavior.  

7.  Versions of PGP later than 5.0 do not support 
    using Microsoft Word as an email editor.

8.  We strongly recommend that VirusScan users
    upgrade to the latest version of VirusScan to
    take advantage of the newest virus DAT file 
    update features.
    

* PGPNET ISSUES *

1.  Do not attempt to manually uninstall PGPnet. 
    It is very important that you use the PGP 
    Uninstaller to remove PGPnet. PGPnet makes 
    extensive modifications to the registry and 
    changes the bindings on network adapters. 
    The PGP Uninstaller can be accessed via the 
    Add/Remove Programs control panel.

2.  [Windows NT only]
    As a precautionary measure, in the unusual 
    event that there is a incompatibility between 
    your network card driver and PGPnet, you can 
    create a "No Networking" hardware profile 
    prior to installing PGPnet on your system. 
    The "No Networking" hardware profile can be 
    used later if an incompatibility occurs.
 
    To create a "No Networking" hardware profile,
    right click on "My Computer," select Properties,
    and then select the Hardware Profiles tab. Use 
    the Copy button to create a copy of the Original 
    Configuration. Get Properties on your copied 
    configuration and click the Network tab.
    Finally, select the "Network-disabled hardware
    profile" checkbox. Click OK to both windows 
    and then you are done. (Due to a Windows bug 
    we recommend that you restart once and 
    double-check that the "No Networking" 
    configuration is working before you
    install PGPnet.)

3.  [Windows 95 only]
    You may experience a loss of networking after
    resuming from standby mode. You must reboot 
    your machine to resume network activity.

4.  PGPnet 6.5.1 is not compatible with the
    Intel EtherExpress 16 driver.   

5.  This freeware version of PGP disables the use
    of X.509 authentication with PGPnet, and also
    does not allow the use of Secure Gateways for
    tunneling. Only the Personal Privacy and 
    Desktop Security versions support these 
    features.

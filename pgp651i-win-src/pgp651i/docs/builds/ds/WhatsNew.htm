<OL>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Arial"><LI>PGPnet.</B> PGPnet is a landmark product in the history of PGP. PGPnet secures all TCP/IP communications between itself and any other machine running PGPnet. It is also highly interoperable with the Gauntlet GVPN firewall/gateway product family providing a complete solution for corporate remote access VPNs using the industry standard IPSec (Internet Protocol Security) and IKE (Internet Key Exchange) protocols. PGPnet has been successfully tested with Cisco routers(requires Cisco IOS 12.0(4) or later with IPSec TripleDES), Linux FreeS/WAN, and many others. PGPnet is also the first IPSec product to fully support the use of OpenPGP keys for authentication in addition to X.509.</LI>
<B><LI>Self-Decrypting Archives.</B> You may now encrypt files or folders into Self-Decrypting Archives (SDA) which can be used by users who do not even have PGP. The archives are completely independent of any application, compressed and protected by PGP's strong cryptography.</LI>
<B><LI>X.509 Certificate and CA Support.</B> PGP is now able to interoperate with the X.509 certificate format. This is the format used by most web browsers for securing the transfer of web pages. PGP supports the request of certificates from Network Associates' Net Tools PKI, VeriSign's OnSite, and Entrust certificate authorities. X.509 certificates are analogous to a PGP signature, so you can even request X.509 certificates on your existing PGP key. This feature can also be used to interoperate with existing VPN solutions based on X.509.</LI>
<B><LI>Integrated PGP Command Line.</B> This version incorporates the popular command line version of PGP for Windows platforms. This product provides you a convenient way to integrate PGP with other Windows applications and automated processes on your desktop system. Please note that this is intended for single user/workstation use. For use on servers, customers are required to purchase the PGP Command Line/Batch Server product. Please contact your local Network Associates Sales representative for more information.</LI>
<B><LI>Automated Freespace Wiping.</B> PGP's Freespace Wipe feature now allows you to use the Windows Task Scheduler to schedule periodic secure wiping of the freespace on your disk.</LI>
<B><LI>Hotkeys.</B> The Use Current Window feature has been significantly enhanced by the addition of Hotkeys. By pressing the configured key combination, the Encrypt/Decrypt/Sign functions can be automatically invoked in zero clicks without using PGPtray.</LI>
<B><LI>Fingerprint Word List.</B> When verifying a PGP public key fingerprint, you can now choose to view the fingerprint as a word list instead of hexadecimal characters. The word list in the fingerprint text box is made up of special authentication words that PGP uses and are carefully selected to be phonetically distinct and easy to understand without phonetic ambiguity.</LI>
<B><LI>Support for Outlook 2000 and Outlook Express 5.0.</B> This version of PGP adds support for sending and receiving encrypted e-mail in Microsoft Outlook 2000 and Outlook Express 5.0.</LI>
<B><LI>HTTP Proxy Support.</B> If you are behind a corporate firewall with an HTTP proxy server, PGP now supports accessing HTTP keyservers through the proxy. To use this feature, you must configure the proxy server address in your Internet Explorer preferences.</LI>
<B><LI>Smart Word Wrapping.</B> The word wrapping in PGP now automatically rewraps paragraphs and even quoted paragraphs resulting in much cleaner signed messages.</LI></OL>

</FONT><B><FONT FACE="Arial" SIZE=4><P><A NAME="Issues"></A>KNOWN ISSUES </P>
</FONT><I><FONT FACE="Arial"><P>PGP ISSUES </P>
<OL>
<OL>

</B></I><LI>The maximum size for RSA keys is 2048 bits. This is due to limitations in the RSA libraries and our desire to remain backward-compatible with previous versions of PGP. (Some previous versions of PGP did function with large RSA keys, but creation of these keys has never been supported.)</LI>
<LI>Mismatching your keyring files can result in data loss. Your public keyring file and private keyring file must be kept in sync. If, for instance, you select a public keyring file that does not contain the public portion of your private key and do not also change the private keyring to the corresponding file, you and others will not be able to encrypt to exported versions of your key after that time. In most cases, simply updating your key from a public copy on a keyserver will fix this. However, it is recommended that the keyring files always be kept in sync. A future version is expected to correct this issue.</LI>
<LI>Using a Split Key as a public key for PGPdisk will not allow reconstitution of the key through the usual dialog provided for reconstituting split keys. To use such a key to open a PGPdisk, you must first rejoin the key in PGPkeys.</LI>
<LI>Some PGP Versions 6.0 and later features are incompatible with previous versions of PGP, so we feature a "compatible" export format that strips incompatible features such as Photo IDs and X.509 certificates from keys. Selecting "Include 6.X Extensions" in the Export dialog enables these features to be exported. By default, we export in compatible mode. You may change the default in the Advanced preferences dialog. When sending a key to a PGP Certificate Server Version 2.0 or above, Photo IDs always accompany the key. The default LDAP server in PGP 6.x supports this.</LI>
<LI>Sometimes, after a PGPdisk volume is unmounted and placed in the Recycle Bin and the Bin is emptied, Windows reports that the drive letter associated with the PGPdisk volume is no longer accessible. This behavior should cease after the system is rebooted. This will not interfere with the normal operation of your system.</LI>
<LI>On Windows 95/98, the Free Space Wiper will reset every time another program writes to your disk while the wiping process is in progress. This is similar to defragmentation programs, and is required by the Operating System. For optimal wiping, make sure to close all open applications. On some systems with very low amounts of RAM, it may be advisable to also shutdown Windows Explorer.</LI>
<LI>The Windows Explorer provides PGP with information only about the target of a shortcut and not the shortcut itself. If you use the Wipe feature in the Explorer, the shortcut itself will not be wiped. The actual target will be wiped. When using PGPtools, the shortcut will also be wiped.</LI>
<LI>Hotkeys are for use with applications that support general text editing. Using Hotkeys with some applications may result in unpredictable behavior.</LI>
<LI>Hard disk utilities (such as ScanDisk) or programs that monitor the hard disk will not run on a drive on which a PGPdisk volume is mounted. This is to insure that the PGPdisk volume does not become corrupted. To use your hard disk utilities, unmount all PGPdisk volumes on the drive on which you wish to use the utilities.</LI>
<LI>PGPdisk volumes accessed using an Additional Decryption Key open with permissions set as follows: FAT volumes open with permissions set to read-only; NTFS volumes open with permissions set to read/write.</LI>
<LI>(Windows 98 only) If you create a PGPdisk which you plan to immediately copy to a different drive, we recommend that you reboot before doing so to make sure everything is written correctly. This is only a potential issue just after the creation of the PGPdisk, and is due to a Windows 98 disk caching bug.</LI>
<LI>Versions of PGP later than 5.0 do not support using Microsoft Word as an email editor.</LI>
<LI>We strongly recommend that VirusScan users upgrade to the latest version of VirusScan to take advantage of the newest virus DAT file update features.</LI></OL>

<B><I><P>PGPNET ISSUES </P>
<OL>
<OL>

</B></I><LI>Do not attempt to manually uninstall PGPnet. It is very important that you use the PGP Uninstaller to remove PGPnet. PGPnet makes extensive modifications to the registry and changes the bindings on network adapters. The PGP Uninstaller can be accessed via the Add/Remove Programs control panel. </LI>
<LI>[Windows NT only] <BR>
As a precautionary measure, in the unusual event that there is a incompatibility between your network card driver and PGPnet, you can create a "No Networking" hardware profile prior to installing PGPnet on your system. The "No Networking" hardware profile can be used later if an incompatibility occurs. </LI>
<P>To create a "No Networking" hardware profile, right click on "My Computer," select Properties, and then select the Hardware Profiles tab. Use the Copy button to create a copy of the Original Configuration. Get Properties on your copied configuration and click the Network tab. Finally, select the "Network-disabled hardware profile" checkbox. Click OK to both windows and then you are done. (Due to a Windows bug we recommend that you restart once and double-check that the "No Networking" configuration is working before you install PGPnet.) </P>
</FONT><LI>[Windows 95 only]<BR>
You may experience a loss of networking after resuming from standby mode. You must reboot your machine to resume network activity.</LI>

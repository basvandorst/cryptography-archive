The requisite tools for buildig PGP on Windows are:

1) MSVC++ 6, with SP3.

2) Windows 98 DDK.

3) NT4 DDK.

4) Platform SDK.

5) InstallShield 5.5x.

6) Vireo driverworks.

7) Vireo Vtools.

You do not need the MS assembler, as it comes with the DDKs.

The install self extractor is built using NAI's proprietary tool MakeSea,
it's one of the tools that you build while building the PGP client.

Sure, you can be an alpha tester.
The federal government sometimes has weird ideas of how
to do things, though, and our main audience is general Internet
users.  Still, if the feds are leading the way in a direction
that it appears we'll all eventually take, that's great.

So far, we haven't given much thought to how RIPEM should
get its keys in a PEM-like (as opposed to direct-trust)
environment.  X.500 is probably a good idea for an option.
I don't know how difficult it is to work with, though.

I have never heard of PP/Quipu.  Tell me more.

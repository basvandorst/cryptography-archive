RIPEM maintains a CRL issued by you.  REVOCATION UNKNOWN means RIPEM
can't find a certificate from the certificate's issuer (you).  To fix
it, here is a section from ripemuse.doc in the Beta 2 release:

Maintaining CRLs is easy using RCERTS. When the validity period on the
CRL issued by you expires, use N to renew it. Any revocation entries
in the CRL will be kept and you can choose the duration of the
validity period of the new CRL. Also, if you don't have any CRLs, this
will create a new one.

I meant to say it means RIPEM can't find a CRL from the issuer.

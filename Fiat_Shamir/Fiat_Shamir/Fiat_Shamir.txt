Abstract : "In this paper we describe simple identification and signature
           schemes which enable any user to prove his identity and the
           authenticity of his messages to any other user without shared
           or public keys. The schemes are provably secure against any known
           or chosen message attack if factoring is difficult, and typical
           implementations require only 1% to 4% of the number of modular
           multiplications required by the RSA scheme. Due to their
           simplicity, security and speed, these schemes are ideally suited
           for microprosessor-based devices such as smart cards, personal
           computers, and remote control systems."

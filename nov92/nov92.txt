             A LETTER FROM THE COMPUTER SYSTEMS LABORATORY
                             CSL

                        NOVEMBER 1992

OSI WORKSHOP:  A CHANGED FOCUS
In 1983, CSL established the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
Implementors Workshop (OIW) to address interoperability problems
encountered by vendors, suppliers, and users in the
implementation of international standards for OSI.  Now
attracting more than 300 participants to its quarterly meetings,
the workshop is cosponsored by NIST and the Institute of
Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Computer Society as a
public technical forum that develops implementation agreements
and test suites for OSI standards.  Its principal output is a set
of stable Implementation Agreements, now totaling over 1500
pages, that specify the conventions to achieve multi-product
interoperability.  Other regional workshops have been formed in
Europe and the Far East.  The three regional workshops
collaborate on their work plans and harmonize the results of
agreements they develop regionally.

Several large U.S. corporations approached the workshop in 1991
to consider developing implementation agreements across the
entire open systems spectrum.  Users and technology providers
expressed a growing interest in developing interoperability
agreements for application programming interfaces (APIs) between
application software and multi-vendor hardware/software
platforms.  

The workshop formed a task group to investigate broadening the
OIW charter to encompass Open System Environments (OSE).  Based
on the task group's recommendations, the workshop plenary voted,
at its December 1991 meeting, to expand the OIW charter and to
change the name to the OSE Implementors Workshop (OIW) to reflect
its expanded role.  Other actions resulting from the change in
focus of the OIW included:

o    establishment of an OSE Technical Committee to develop new
     procedures needed to manage OSE projects;

o    consideration of the use of publicly available
     specifications to fill gaps in areas where international
     standards are not available; and

o    acceptance of user requirements for open systems from
     outside groups.

During 1992, the workshop has been developing procedures for
processing user requirements, and several special interest groups
(SIGs) are collaborating with groups from other standards-
development organizations (IEEE, European Workshop for Open
Systems [EWOS], etc.) to incorporate emerging APIs and
specifications into the OIW's Implementation Agreements.  Several
liaisons have been established with formal standards technical
committees such as the IEEE Technical Committee on Operating
System (TCOS) groups.  These collaborations are expected to
accelerate the adoption of new work done by standards groups and
consortia and compress the time needed to incorporate
specifications into new OSE products.

The future promises to bring more involvement from the vendor
community and consortia, as well as a better process for
developing OSE user requirements.  Additionally, the expanded
workshop will address migration issues that arise when providers
and users begin to adopt open systems while still needing to run
systems currently in place. 

NIST Special Publication 500-202, Stable Implementation
Agreements for Open Systems Interconnection Protocol, Version 5,
Edition 1, December 1991, is the current version of the stable
Implementation Agreements document.  It may be purchased from the
Government Printing Office, (202) 783-3238, order number SN903-

newsletter for future meeting dates of the OIW.


FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING STANDARD (FIPS) ACTIVITIES

Review of FIPS 46-1, Data Encryption Standard (DES)
Issued in 1977, the DES provides an algorithm to be implemented
in electronic hardware devices and used for the cryptographic
protection of computer data.  Reaffirmed for federal agency use
in 1983 and 1987, the current review seeks to assess the adequacy
of the standard to continue to protect computer data.  The review
offers three options:  reaffirmation of the standard for another
five years; withdrawal of the standard; and revision of the
applicability or implementation statements of the standard.

Copies of FIPS 46-1 may be obtained from the National Technical
Information Service at (703) 487-4650.  Written comments should
be sent to Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, ATTN:  Review
of FIPS 46-1, Technology Bldg., Room B154, NIST, Gaithersburg, MD
20899.  The comment deadline is December 10, 1992.  We welcome
your views.

Minor Technical Changes to FIPS 146-1, Government Open Systems
Interconnection Profile (GOSIP)
Effective October 21, 1992, three technical changes to FIPS 146-
1 were made to align Version 2 of GOSIP with revisions to the
Workshop Agreements, to adopt increased functionality for GOSIP
users, and to improve interoperability among GOSIP products.  The
first change affects the requirement for the procurement of VT
simple systems, i.e., those that support the TELNET VT-profile. 
The second change deals with the bit settings of the Encoded
Information Types when an Office Document Architecture (ODA)
document is present.  The third change requires that Message
Handling Systems implementations be able to generate domain-
defined attributes.  For more information, call our FIPS Office
at (301) 975-2816 for a copy of the FIPS Publication Change
Notice. 

Spatial Data Transfer Standard Approved As FIPS
As announced in the Federal Register of August 28, 1992, the
Secretary of Commerce approved the Spatial Data Transfer Standard
(SDTS) as FIPS 173.  To be effective February 15, 1993, FIPS 173
will facilitate the transfer of digital spatial data between
dissimilar computer systems.

The SDTS provides specifications for the organization and
structure of digital spatial data transfer, definition of spatial
features and attributes, and data transfer encoding.  The
standard was developed through a government/industry cooperative
effort headed by the Department of the Interior.  In addition to
serving as the national spatial data transfer mechanism for
federal agencies, the SDTS is being made available for use to
state and local governments, the private sector, and academia.

Three FIPS for Telecommunications Wiring Approved
The Secretary of Commerce approved three new telecommunications
wiring standards for federal agency use, effective March 1, 1993. 
FIPS 174, Federal Building Telecommunications Wiring Standard,
adopts ANSI/EIA/TIA-568-1991 and specifies minimum requirements
for telecommunications wiring within a building and between
buildings in a campus environment.  FIPS 175, Federal Building
Standard for Telecommunications Pathways and Spaces, specifies
minimum requirements for telecommunications pathways and spaces
within a federal office building and between office buildings in
a campus environment, by the adoption of ANSI/EIA/TIA-569-1990. 
FIPS 176, Residential and Light Commercial Telecommunications
Wiring Standard, through adoption of ANSI/EIA/TIA-570-1991,
provides federal agencies with a generic, standardized premises-
wiring system intended for connecting one to four exchange access
lines to various types of customer-premises equipment.

The new FIPS are available from the National Technical
Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road, Springfield, VA
22161, telephone (703) 487-4650.

CSL Develops Technical Interpretation to FIPS 21-3, COBOL
The Federal Register of July 29, 1992, announced the adoption of
Technical Interpretation No. 1 for FIPS 21-3, COBOL.  Pertaining
to the handling of invalid arguments in intrinsic functions for
COBOL, the technical interpretation serves as additional
specifications but requires no change to FIPS 21-3, which was
effective on June 29, 1990.  For a copy of the Federal Register
notice detailing the technical interpretation, call our FIPS
Office at (301) 975-2816.

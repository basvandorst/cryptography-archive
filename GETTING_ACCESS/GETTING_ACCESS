Dear FTP user,

To access the RIPEM cryptographic software archive at ripem.msu.edu,
you must have an "account" on my custom FTP server.  Traditional
anonymous FTP login is allowed, but anonymous users are prevented
from doing GETs on files containing cryptographic software.
Anonymous access is allowed so that you can get README-type files
like this one, and files containing descriptions of software
licensing terms.

This FTP server is not an official service at all.  Although 
accounts have no specific expiration dates, your account (or 
more likely, the service as a whole) could be discontinued at
any time without any advance notice (even to me).

To apply for FTP access to rpub.cl.msu.edu, send an email message
to ripem@ripem.msu.edu.   State the following:

1.  Your citizenship (must be USA or Canadian) 
2.  Your willingness to comply with relevant export laws.
3.  Your willingness to comply with relevant software license terms.
    (You should get and read the file "rsaref-license.txt" on this host, 
    so you know what you are agreeing to if you get RIPEM.)  
4.  The "canonical" Internet domain name of your host.
    (If you are not sure of the primary name of your host, FTP to
    ripem.msu.edu under user anonymous.  The FTP server will inform
    you of your hostname.)  Also state the country in which your host
    resides.

*****
***** NOTE:  It is very important that you get the hostname correct.
*****        As odd as it may seem, many requestors have
*****        not correctly specified their host address.  This
*****        causes extra effort for both of us.  Please check
*****        (via anonymous FTP) unless you are certain of your
*****        hostname as known by domain name servers.  Your
*****        hostname does *** NOT *** have an "@" in it, and
*****        in general cannot be derived from your email address.

Here's a sample email message you might send to ripem@ripem.msu.edu:

To: ripem@ripem.msu.edu
Subject: Access to ripem.msu.edu

   Dear Mark,

   Please give me access to ripem.msu.edu.  I am an American
   citizen, and I agree to comply with crypto export laws and
   RSAREF license terms.  My hostname is hobbit.egr.bigu.edu;
   this host is located in the United States.

   Thank you.

When I receive your message, with luck I'll promptly issue you
a special FTP username and password by return email.  This username 
will work only from the hostname you specify in your message.

In the case of RIPEM, you may redistribute the code, but only
to others in the USA and Canada, and only under the terms of
the RSAREF license agreement mentioned above.

Thank you.

This method of distribution is due to local site requirements 
and is not required by RSAREF license terms, FYI.

Mark Riordan   mrr@scss3.cl.msu.edu

P.S.  I realize that going through this account application process 
is not your idea of a good time.  It doesn't take much imagination
to figure that it isn't my idea of a good time, either.  Please
help this process go smoothly by giving me all the informative
requested above, so I can issue your account on the first try.
I receive hundreds of these requests and many are lacking information.

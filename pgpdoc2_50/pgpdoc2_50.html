<H3>Message digests and digital signatures</H3>
<P>To create a digital signature, PGP encrypts with your secret key. 
But PGP doesn't actually encrypt your entire message with your secret
key-- that would take too long.  Instead, PGP encrypts a "message
digest".  
<P>The message digest is a compact (128 bit) "distillate" of your
message, similar in concept to a checksum.  You can also think of it
as a "fingerprint" of the message.  The message digest "represents"
your message, such that if the message were altered in any way, a
different message digest would be computed from it.  This makes it
possible to detect any changes made to the message by a forger.  A
message digest is computed using a cryptographically strong one-way
hash function of the message.  It would be computationally infeasible
for an attacker to devise a substitute message that would produce an
identical message digest.  In that respect, a message digest is much
better than a checksum, because it is easy to devise a different
message that would produce the same checksum.  But like a checksum,
you can't derive the original message from its message digest.  
<P>A message digest alone is not enough to authenticate a message.  The
message digest algorithm is publicly known, and does not require
knowledge of any secret keys to calculate.  If all we did was attach
a message digest to a message, then a forger could alter a message
and simply attach a new message digest calculated from the new
altered message.  To provide real authentication, the sender has to
encrypt (sign) the message digest with his secret key.  
<P>A message digest is calculated from the message by the sender.  The
sender's secret key is used to encrypt the message digest and an
electronic timestamp, forming a digital signature, or signature
certificate.  The sender sends the digital signature along with the
message.  The receiver receives the message and the digital
signature, and recovers the original message digest from the digital
signature by decrypting it with the sender's public key.  The
receiver computes a new message digest from the message, and checks
to see if it matches the one recovered from the digital signature.  If
it matches, then that proves the message was not altered, and it came
from the sender who owns the public key used to check the signature.
<P>A potential forger would have to either produce an altered message
that produces an identical message digest (which is infeasible), or
he would have to create a new digital signature from a different
message digest (also infeasible, without knowing the true sender's
secret key).
<P>Digital signatures prove who sent the message, and that the message
was not altered either by error or design.  It also provides
non-repudiation, which means the sender cannot easily disavow his
signature on the message.
<P>Using message digests to form digital signatures has other advantages
besides being faster than directly signing the entire actual message
with the secret key.  Using message digests allows signatures to be
of a standard small fixed size, regardless of the size of the actual
message.  It also allows the software to check the message integrity
automatically, in a manner similar to using checksums.  And it allows
signatures to be stored separately from messages, perhaps even in a
public archive, without revealing sensitive information about the
actual messages, because no one can derive any message content from a
message digest.
<P>The message digest algorithm used here is the MD5 Message Digest
Algorithm, placed in the public domain by RSA Data Security, Inc.
MD5's designer, Ronald Rivest, writes this about MD5:
<P>"It is conjectured that the difficulty of coming up with two messages
having the same message digest is on the order of 2^64 operations,
and that the difficulty of coming up with any message having a given
message digest is on the order of 2^128 operations.  The MD5
algorithm has been carefully scrutinized for weaknesses.  It is,
however, a relatively new algorithm and further security analysis is
of course justified, as is the case with any new proposal of this
sort.  The level of security provided by MD5 should be sufficient for
implementing very high security hybrid digital signature schemes
based on MD5 and the RSA public-key cryptosystem."

PGP for Personal Privacy, Version 5.0
	Release Notes
	Windows 95/NT



Important Notes:

1)	Eudora must be upgraded to Version 3.0.2 in order for the Eudora
Plug-in to function properly.  The appropriate update files are available from
the Qualcomm Eudora website for both Eudora Pro and Eudora Light.  Only
Version 3.0.2 and above will work.

2)	Using Microsoft Word as your editor in Outlook is not currently
supported.  The Exchange/Outlook Plug-in will not be available in Word.
Switching your editor back to the Outlook editor will correct the issue.

3)	When using PGP/MIME to send encrypted and/or signed messages, we
suggest you use the PGP/MIME button on Eudora's toolbar rather than the
Plug-in menu. Using the Plug-in menu may produce unpredictable results.

4)	Please read the PGP 5.0 FAQ on the PGP web site (http://www.pgp.com/)
for answers to Frequently Asked Questions.

Please send any reports of problems, suggestions, or comments to
pgp50bugs@pgp.com, or see the help file for Technical Support information.

We hope you enjoy using this new generation of PGP!

Thanks!
The PGP 5.0 Development Team

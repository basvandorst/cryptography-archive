List of things to do.

* pgp_old is completely unimplemented

* -u doesn't check for multiple signing keys specified

* error codes need to be more rigorous to enable reasonable scripting

* keyserver support should be a little more informative when you enter
a protocol it doesn't support.  Also, I need to port all of the
connections error messages from the Windoze version; right now, if
(i.e.) you enter a nonexistant hostname, you don't get a warning
message.

* url.c needs to be rewritten to handle dynamic allocation for URL
parsing instead of using static buffers

* The PAGER directive in config.txt doesn't work.

* "Echo passphrase" not supported

* No UI support for MRKs

* Turning on batch mode doesn't do all that it should

* Verbosity levels aren't particularly implemented

* Keyserver support should ask for verification prior to adding keys
to your keyring

* In batch mode, there's as yet no user interface that allows you to
specify output handles for each type of output

---

Fix before tomorrow:

* We're probably not handling DSS/RSA warning issues (signing and
encrypting with multiple keys) very well at this time.

* No UI support for preferred-algorithm functionality

* Man page rewrite

* Update the usage to reflect the new man pages

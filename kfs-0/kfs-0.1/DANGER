U.S. laws expressly forbid the export of cryptographic software under
ITAR laws.  It is illegal to send this software to anyone who is not
a citizen or permanent resident of the U.S. or Canada under current
laws (November, 1993).  Until this policy changes, you are strongly
advised to adhere to the law and protect this software from being

and don't email it to others unless you know they meet the above
requirements and are on a machine located in the U.S. or Canada.

I am not a lawyer, and the above should not be construed as legal
advice.  I urge you to consult a qualified attorney if you are
contemplating redistribution of this software or use by anyone not
a resident of the U.S. or Canada and/or on a machine not located in
the U.S. or Canada.

From kernel 1.1.23 and onwards the loop device may be mounted on a device
of your choice. This is because the latest modules code lets you change
exported code from the module upon loading.

To take advantage of this you must have the latest modules code from

	nic.funet.fi:/pub/OS/Linux/PEOPLE/Linus/v1.1/modules.tar.gz

The default loop major device no. is still 28. However you can change it, for
example for a major device of 30, with the command

	# insmod loop.o loop_major=30

Your kernel syslog should report if this was successful, like

	Jul  3 21:32:06 linux kernel: loop: registered module at major 30

and the "ksyms" command that comes with the module package should show

	# ksyms
	Address  Symbol         Defined by
	0100bfbc _loop_major    [loop]

Make sure you remove the old loop devices and remake new ones as shown in
the README, substituting your choice of the major number.

Recently, I have been asking questions on the net regarding literature on HW
design with FPGAs and the applicability of FPGAs to the implementation of
cryptographic algorithms. This is a summary of the information I have received
and that I figured out myself in the mean time. This article will be sent to
the newsgroup comp.lsi and to the Xilinx Users mailing list.

Thanks for their replies to: 
Herman Schmit (herman@amc.ece.cmu.edu),

Mark Shand (shand@prl.dec.com)

I apologize to any person that send me a message but that I forgot to include
in the above list.


With regard to general design questions when designing with FPGAs, there are
two new books out:

Stephen Trimberger, ed.
"Field-Programmable Gate Array Technology"
Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1994

Jesse Jenkins
"Designing with FPGAs and CPLDs"
Prentice Hall
ISBN 0-13-721549-5

I aquired the later book from Computer Literacy Bookstores (Cupertino, 
Sunnyvale, San Jose, CA) for US$ 45. I haven't taken a look at it yet, 
so I can't say whether it is good or not.


I discovered that there is a mailing list for people using or being interested
in Xilinx products. It can be reached at XILINX-USERS@SANDIA.GOV. To be added
to the list, send an email to XILINX-USERS-REQUEST@SANDIA.GOV with the line
LIST:ADD. The feedback from this list seems to be far better than from comp.lsi
In particular, Xilinx staff seems to read the messages there quite regularly.


There is an international workshop dealing exclusively with FPGAs:

1st International Workshop on Field Programmable Gate Arrays, Feb. 16-18, 
1992, Berkeley, CA

Field-Programmable Gate Arrays: Architectures and Tools for Rapid Prototyping.
Second International Workshop on Field Programmable Logic and Applications.

Sorry, but the reference to the 2nd workshop is incomplete. There was also
a workshop in 1993, for which I don't have the reference, and there is one
coming up this year.


The people at DEC's Paris Research Laboratory have done fast implementations
of RSA (among other algorithms) on their PAM (programmable active memories).
These are basically configurable matrices of Xilinx FPGAs. There are two
research reports available via anonymous ftp to gatekeeper.pa.dec.com on 
these implementations. The files are in /pub/DEC/PRL/research-reports:

Report 3: Bertin, P.; Roncin, D.; Vuillemin, J.: Introduction to Programmable 
Active Memories. June 1989

Report 4: Bertin, P.; Roncin, D.; Vuillemin, J.: Programmable Active Memories
a Performance Assessment. March 1993

The first arcticle has also been published in: "Systolic Array Processors"
(ed. McCanny, J.; McWhirter, J.; Swartzlander, E.), pp. 301-309 (1989)

The second article was also published in: Parallel Architectures and Their
Efficient Use. Proceedings First Heinz Nixdorf Symposium, Paderborn, Germany,
Nov. 11-13, 1992

For those who have not access to ftp, there is also a automated mail server
at DEC PRL. Try sending an email message with the subject line "help" to
doc-server@prl.dec.com.


Two other conference papers by the PRL group are:

Shand, M.; Bertin, P.; Vuillemin, J.: "Hardware speedups in Long Integer
Multiplication". Proceedings 2nd Annual ACM symposium on Parallel Algorithms
and Architectures, July 2-6, 1990, Crete, Greece, pp. 138-145

Reprinted in ACM Computer Architecture News Vol. 10, No. 1, March 1991,
pp. 106-113

Shand, M.; Vuillemin, J.: "Fast Implementations of RSA Cryptography"
Proceedings 11th Symposium on Computer Arithmetic, June 29-July 2, 1993,
Windsor, Ontario, pp 252-259


There is an architecture called SPLASH, which is a linear logic array built
from Xilinx FPGAs. It was used to solve gene matching problems, but it 
could probably also be used for cryptographic algorithms. It is described
in 

Waugh, T.C.: Field Programmable Gate Arrays Key to Reconfigurable Array
Outperforming Supercomputers. Proceedings IEEE 1991 Custom Integrated
Circuits Conference, San Diego, CA, USA, 12-15 May 1991, p 6.6/1-4 


I have also received messages about successful implementations of DES
on Xilinx FPGAs, both the 3000 and the 4000 series.

Appended are the email replies I received in reply to my questions:



From: Herman Schmit <herman@amc.ece.cmu.edu>

The official DES documentation states that no software implementation
of the DES is acceptably secure.  I'm no security expert, but perhaps
that's the reason that no one has commercially done DES on an FPGA.
I guess the configuration bitstream for an FPGA could be broken into
and compromised.

We have been experimenting with high-level synthesis and FPGAs, and
have played around with the DES.  We've found that its really easy and
efficient to implement the cypher function on a 4000 series FPGA.
Basically this function, which is the core of the DES (I think its
used 16 times in the DES) can be implemented just a couple of CLBs and
a lot of routing sources.  I'm sure that the whole DES could fit onto
a single relatively small FPGA, and a large FPGA could probably be
pretty highly pipelined.

Hi,

It has been done. The people at the Paris Digital Research Lab built
something (it was based on the PERL board and was a lot faster than
any other known supercomputer implementation) In addition, I have a student 
who is nearly finished with with a DES engine on Xilinx 3000 parts.
Actually, FPGAs seem to be a good fit with encryption.

Subject: Re: Implementing crypto algorithms on Xilinx?

The type of application can be emulated using Quickturn Emulation Systems easily.
You can consider using Quickturn Box as if it is a very large FPGA.

Since more and more people are starting to use ASIC emulation technology for
algorithm verification, I thought you would like to know.

I'm sure  you will get a lot of responses to this one but just in case you 
haven't -- the people at DEC Paris Labs have done a lot of work in this area
and they implemented the RSA encryption algorithm on their machine and they
have phenomenal results. Here is a reference:

P. Bertin, et. al. "Introduction to Programmable Active Memories", DEC Paris
Laboratory, Technical Report 3, 1989. 


I'm sure that people at the Supercomputing Research Center (SRC) and other
places have also tried various algorithms on their Splash architecture. 
There is a whole workshop devoted to  this and related areas --- IEEE 
Workshop on FPGA's for Custom Computing Machines.

     whose subject line  is : "order report ..<number>."
     Enter your postal mail address in body message.
     The librarian will handle your request and send you the article
     you're asking for.

     Electronic Version
     ------------------
     FTP Information:
     ============
      These files are also available on gatekeeper.dec.com (login anonymous) in
      the directory pub/DEC/PRL/research-reports. They are in PostScript
      compressed format.

     DOC-SERVER Information:
     ======================
     If you wish to receive by electronic mail any of  these reports, 
     write an electronic message to:

          doc-server@prl.dec.com
          or
          decprl::doc-server

     whose subject line  is : "send report ..<number>."
     Please, do not repeat in message body your command order.
     The doc-server will mail you back the report you ask for.
     You can receive abstracts for reports : mail doc-server
     a message whose subject is "send reports abstracts".

     Usually, you have choice between two files : 
          - 'normal' size 
          - 'large' . 

     'Normal' means the report is divided in few separate 
     parts, (usually 3 to 8), whose size is under 100kb, to ensure 
     correct transmission through all mail gateways.           
     
     **'large' versions means a file containing the whole report.** 
       File size is often over 200 ko. Many mail gateways bounce 
       back after 100 ko or will not transmit more , due to mail
       limitations inherent to their network.

     **Please, choose this option after making sure your network**
     **configuration between PRL and your site allows such size.**

From: Norman Chan <nchan@crusader.xilinx.com>

Norbert, 

	The folks at DEC wrote an article that presents quantitative performance
measurements for the computing power of Programmable Active Memories or PAM. The
name of the article is Programmable Active Memories: a Performance Assessment, 
and it is based on Programmable Gate Array technology. It includes 10 PAM 
applications and RSA cryptography is one of them. I'll be willing to fax you a 
copy of it if you email me your fax number.

        Also, Steve Trimberger at Xilinx recently completed a book on FPGAs thatincludes architecture, software and applications discussions of SRAM, Antifuse and EPLD-style FPGAs.  Chapters were written by people from Xilinx, Actel and Altera.  The book is:
		
		"Field-Programmable Gate Array Technology," 
		 Stephen Trimberger, ed.,
	 	 Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1994.

If you are interested, please contact:
  Email: kluwer@world.std.com
  Phone: USA-617-871-6600	or Netherlands (0)78-524400
  Fax:   USA-617-871-6528	or Netherlands (0)78-524474

Jesse Jenkins at Xilinx also wrote a book titled "Designing with FPGAs and 
EPLDs"  and is published by Prentice-Hall. The ISBN number is 0-13-721549-5. It is available in several technical bookstores (locally at Computer Literacy).  
Prentice-Hall can be contacted at 1-800-223-1360 for more information.  It 
includes twelve chapters and describes architectures and appropriate design 
techniques for most commercially available products as well as critical 
architecture needs and design software capabilities. Jesse uses it to teach at 
Santa Clara, Berkeley extension, and Santa Cruz extension.

Hope this helps.

<H2>Sending ASCII text files across different machine
  environments</H2>
<P>You may use PGP to encrypt any kind of plaintext file, binary 8-bit
data or ASCII text.  Probably the most common usage of PGP will be for
E-mail, when the plaintext is ASCII text.  
<P>ASCII text is sometimes represented differently on different
machines.  For example, on an MSDOS system, all lines of ASCII text
are terminated with a carriage return followed by a linefeed.  On a
Unix system, all lines end with just a linefeed.  On a Macintosh, all
lines end with just a carriage return.  This is a sad fact of life.
<P>Normal unencrypted ASCII text messages are often automatically
translated to some common <I>canonical</I> form when they are
transmitted from one machine to another.  Canonical text has a
carriage return and a linefeed at the end of each line of text.  For
example, the popular KERMIT communication protocol can convert text to
canonical form when transmitting it to another system.  This gets
converted back to local text line terminators by the receiving
KERMIT.  This makes it easy to share text files across
different systems.
<P>But encrypted text cannot be automatically converted by a
communication protocol, because the plaintext is hidden by
encipherment.  To remedy this inconvenience, PGP lets you specify
that the plaintext should be treated as ASCII text (not binary data)
and should be converted to canonical text form before it gets
encrypted.  At the receiving end, the decrypted plaintext is
automatically converted back to whatever text form is appropriate for
the local environment.
<P>To make PGP assume the plaintext is text that should be converted to
canonical text before encryption, just add the <KBD>t</KBD> option when
encrypting or signing a message, like so:
<PRE>
   pgp -et message.txt her_userid
</PRE>
This mode is automatically turned off if PGP detects that the
plaintext file contains what it thinks is non-text binary data.
<P>If you need to use the <KBD>-t</KBD> option a lot, you can just turn on the
TEXTMODE flag in the PGP configuration file.  That's what I do.
<P>For PGP users that use non-English 8-bit character sets, when PGP 
converts text to canonical form, it may convert data from the local
character set into the LATIN1 (ISO 8859-1 Latin Alphabet 1) character
set, depending on the setting of the CHARSET parameter in the PGP
configuration file.  LATIN1 is a superset of ASCII, with extra
characters added for many European languages.

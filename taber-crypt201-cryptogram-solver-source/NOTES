When link editing, use NEW as the response file.  Also, be sure to specify MASM
switch /a to force segment order as shown in CRYPT.MAP.  ZZZ.OBJ is the stack
segment and must be last because CRYPT manages its own memory and uses the
stack registers to determine the beginning of available memory.  More recent
assemblers screw around with the order of segments to make everything more
C-like, so you must use the switch.  My preferred order is
	all code segments
	all data segments
	stack
to facilitate debugging.

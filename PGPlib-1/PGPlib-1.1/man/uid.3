.Sh NAME
.Nm uid
.Nd routines to manipulate user identifications
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <pgplib.h>
.Ft int
.Fn uid2buf "PGPuserid_t *uid" "u_char **buf"
.Ft int
.Fn buf2uid "u_char *buf" "int len" "PGPuserid_t *uid"
.Ft void
.Fn free_uid "PGPuserid_t *uid"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These routines manipulate user identificatiom packages.
.Fn uid2buf
and
.Fn buf2uid
operate on a package compatible with RFC1991 that store strings
containing the "name" associated with keys.
The size of the buffer returned by the former can be found with
.Fn get_packetlen .
.Fn free_uid
only frees the internal state (and not the space occupied by the
structure).
\.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon success 0 is returned.  If an error occurs, -1 is returned.
.Fn buf2uid
will return 1 if there is a syntax error in the input.

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr free 3
.Xr malloc 3
.Xr get_packetlen PGPlib
.Xr PGPlib 3
\.
.Sh STANDARDS
The packet generated by
.Fn uid2buf 
is compatible with the format described in RFC1991.

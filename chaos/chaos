Bonjour,

You may have written me to receive the new computer security e-journal
called Chaos Digest.

The Digest presents some security aspects: frauds, hacking, swapping,
legislation, phreaking ...

The delivery costs are extremely expensive on the CCCF AT&T account,
and if you would receive all issues, don't hesitate to subscribe.

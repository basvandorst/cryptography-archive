<hr>

<p><strong>If your WebID users report repeated authentication
failures, make sure that:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>the ACE/Agent plugin has been initialized during Web
        server startup. If the plugin has not been initialized,
        check for ACE/Agent initialization error messages in the
        startup monitor, then follow the solutions in the <a
        href="startup.html">ACE/Agent startup messages
        troubleshooting</a>.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>the ACE/Agent is receiving the <a href="trb00018.html">required
        parameters</a> from the Web client. Check for error
        messages in the Netscape Server log, then follow the
        solutions in <a href="logms.html">ACE/Agent Messages in
        the the Netscape Server Log</a>.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>the ACE/Agent is able to find the <strong>sdconf.rec</strong>
        file (the configuration file that the ACE/Agent needs to
        communicate with the ACE/Server.) The path to the <strong>sdconf.rec</strong>
        file must be specified in the <strong>VAR_ACE</strong>
        parameter of the <a href="ace00050.html"><strong>aceagent.cfg</strong></a>
        file.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>the ACE/Agent is able to find the Web authentication form
        templates. If these files have been moved from the <em><strong>netscape_home_directory</strong></em><strong>/plugins/aceagent/templates</strong>
        directory, you must specify their location in the <strong>TemplatesPath
        </strong>parameter of the <strong>aceagent.cfg</strong>
        file.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>the Web clients are sending the authentication requests
        using the POST method (the GET method is not supported).
        Check the <a href="ace00048.html">Web authentication form
        templates</a> to make sure that <strong>METHOD=POST</strong>
        is specified in the FORM tags.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>the users who are attempting to authenticate are using
        browsers that support HTML forms and <font size="3"
        face="Times New Roman, Times">Persistent Client State
        HTTP Cookies. <br>
        Security Dynamics supports Netscape Navigator versions
        1.1 or later and Microsoft Internet Explorer versions 3.0
        or later browsers for authentication through the WebID
        authentication forms. Other browsers may work, but you
        should consult their manufacturers to make sure the
        browsers support HTML forms and Persistent Client State
        HTTP Cookies. <br>
        <img src="ace00005.gif" width="21" height="21"> </font><font
        color="#800000" size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times"><strong>Note:</strong></font><font
        size="3" face="Times New Roman, Times"> If a user reports
        that he or she is able to authenticate once but is then
        repeatedly prompted for a PASSCODE, instruct the user to
        exit and restart the Web browser, then authenticate
        again. This solves an infrequent problem associated with
        WebID cookies.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></li>
    <li>the users who are attempting to authenticate have been <a
        href="ace00004.html">registered as tokenholders</a> in
        the ACE/Server database.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>the ACE/Agent machine has been <a href="ace00004.html">registered
        as a UNIX client</a> of the ACE/Server.</li>

face="Arial"><strong>Erratic Cookie Expiriation</strong></font></h2>

<p><strong>If your WebID users report being prompted to
authenticate before their cookies expire:</strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>make sure the users are consistent when entering URLs
        manually in their browser's <strong>Location</strong>
        box. <br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
        For example, if Sarah authenticates on server <font
        size="2" face="Arial"><strong>sales.mydomain.com</strong>
        </font>using the URL <font size="2" face="Arial"><strong>http://sales.mydomain.com/index.html</strong></font>,
        she should continue to use the <font size="2"
        face="Arial"><strong>http://sales.mydomain.com</strong></font>
        naming scheme during this browsing session. Once inside
        the domain, if she were to enter the shortcut <font
        size="2" face="Arial"><strong>http://sales/monthly/figures.html</strong></font>,
        she would be prompted to authenticate because the domain
        name in her cookie (<strong>sales.mydomain.com</strong>)
        would not exactly match the domain name of the URL she is
        attempting to access (<strong>sales</strong>).<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
    <li>make sure your HTML authors are using a consistent,
        standard domain referencing scheme when linking from one
        server within teh domain to another server withing the
        domain. For example, if one author is using <font
        size="2" face="Arial"><strong>server.mydomain.com</strong></font>,
        all the authors should use this standard. This will
        prevent your users from having to reauthenticate
        unnecessarily.</li>
</ul>

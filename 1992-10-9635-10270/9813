   Absolutely correct, unless you get official permission for the export.

The rules were recently loosened just a little so that "mass-market"
software packages using RSA's RC2 and RC4 algorithms can be exported
freely, and the review process streamlined for others. They didn't
budge on DES, though. Source: Software Publisher's Association,
Washington DC.

   However, they do mean that no US company that might compete with Mantis can
   use DES or RSA in products it ships to Europe.  Neat, huh?
You've been warned! Duck!

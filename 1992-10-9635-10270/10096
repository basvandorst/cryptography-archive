Since I posted this message yesterday, several people have
sent me mail to correct my flakey memory of dates.  The Jefferson
cipher was unused for many years, and then reinvented in the
1920s and used up through WWII by the Navy in a modified form.

Without a copy of the Codebreakers in front of me, my memory
gets uncorrectable errors.  Mea culpa....

Thanks to smb@ulysses.att.com, reeds@research.att.com, and
and cme@ellisun.sw.stratus.com for pointing out my error.

Now  -   does anyone know what Jefferson wrote on the use
of cryptography in a political sense?  I tried several
biographies of him last night, and couldn't find the quote.

Paul

Absolutely correct.  It should be noted that the "Enigma crack" did NOT 
crack all Enigma ciphers being used by all branches of the German military
service.  Luftwaffe codes were regularly broken because their operators
tended to be lazy and incompetent.  The Naval codes were only infrequently
broken, and there was at least one branch of the service (the SS?) whose
Enigma codes were NEVER broken during the course of the war.  See John 
Keegan's "The Second World War" for more exact information.

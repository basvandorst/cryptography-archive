While in many cases, it is possible to detect the fact that
all communications are being trapped, that is not the case if
the computer in question is being used in a dedicated applications
environment with non-computer-literate users or worse still in an
isolated location with no on-site operators, but only a security guard 
at the door.

For example, a commercial system at an oil-drilling site or a defense radar
system at an isolated radar site could easily be vulnerable to complete 
trapping and spoofing of communications.  Even a bank in downtown Manhattan
could be vulnerable, if no one in the branch was familiar with the signs
that spoofing is happening!  The common attitude is that if the computer
says so, then it must be right.  

This is a people problem, not a mathematical
problem, but encryption must be used in the real world, not in an ivory
tower.  That is why keys need to get changed and procedures are very critical.
The British would likely not have broken Enigma during WWII, if the Germans
had used the system in its theoretically best ways.  Most of the breaks
came from bad procedures and lazy crypto operators.

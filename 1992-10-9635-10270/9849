This is not really true because a laser amplifier will always add
noise due to spontaneous emission. After some time, your signal to
noise ratio will start to degrade and at some point, you will lose
the signal totally.
From what I have seen with long distance fiber optic systems, you can
probably not do it over more than about 10000 or 20000 km of fiber,
which corresponds to a delay of about 0.1 seconds.

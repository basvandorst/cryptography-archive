Why not use another more obscure text and do the same thing.  For example  
use a different pulp romance novel each time and associate your sins with  
those which actually occured in the book used.  This is by no means  
uncrackable, just real obscure.  It breaks down when you have to tell your  
partner what book to use, if someone were to find out they would have your  
code down cold in minutes.  The way around this is to use an encryption  
like RSA where each person has his/her own key thus no key to have to  
transmit, no key to intercept.

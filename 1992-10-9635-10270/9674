It is actually more that the Elliptic Curve Algorithm has made such criteria
irrelevent. The problem is that for p sufficiently large, it is likely that
there exists a number near p, p+/-k (say) with k < 2sqrt(p)) such that all of
its factors are small. [the exact probability can be quantified with 
Dickman's function. See my forthcoming paper with Sam Wagstaff to appear in
Math. Comp. which outlines this].  

Under such conditions ECM can get lucky and there is NO way to prevent it.

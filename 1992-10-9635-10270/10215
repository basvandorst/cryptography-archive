You won't get off the hook by minimizing your support of the fascism you call
"regulation for the common good".  BTW, that's literal fascism, as in what
was practiced by Mussolini and Hitler, not just a trite epithet.  Individual
Liberty IS the common good.

Shall we call this ignorance or bigotry?  Assuming the former, allow me to
inform you that we know why there's so much firearms violence here, it's
because of the black market drug price support program (a.k.a. "War on Drugs"),
the income tax, inflation, the abhominable public schools, and the very same
regulations you meekly find not one fault with.

No, but they'd be justifiably horrified (but perhaps not surprised) at the
meek acceptance of tyranny by most.

All it takes is for the majority to vote away their rights in exchange for
"privileges" which centralize power, which will then be exercised upon them
in turn.

It's far easier for tyranny to establish itself if its victims are unarmed
than if they aren't.  Switzerland has machine guns in most homes, and is
quite free and stable.  History is filled with cases where minorities could
have defended themselves if only they'd had firearms, and, to bring this
back to the point, freedom of communication has proved itself a necessary
condition for the defeat of tyranny.

Incorrect.  The expected time of a random search is N.  The expected
time of an exhaustive search is N/2.  There is no upper bound on the
time of a random search.  The upper bound on exhaustive search is N.

Hence it really only takes twice as long.  See the article on the
Chinese Lottery I mentioned earlier.  It is exactly this argument.

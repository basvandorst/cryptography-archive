I have used encrypted e-mail with friends since 1980, have never registered
the keys used and have no intention of ever doing so.

No argument on my part against allowing the government to tap my encrypted
e-mail included any suggestion that I would give up free speech, free
press or freedom of assembly.

In particular, we need the free press -- the freedom to publish our own
handouts, fliers, ... -- to pass around directories of public keys
which have bypassed any attempted government interference.

We also need to use the Postal Service or Federal Express or DHL or
UPS to ship around floppy disks of encrypted information, in case the
Gov't somehow manages to restrict what kind of information may be
transmitted over interstate networks or amateur radio links.

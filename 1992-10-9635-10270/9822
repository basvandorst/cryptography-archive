        Hmmm... I'm new to all this DES stuff...But do have a general 
purpose DES encripter that I can run in a batch file!!

        After reading all theas messeges about trying to brake 
DES....well has anyone ever thought that only a dum &^%$ would only 
encript a file/text only ONCE?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?

        Of cores if you have than I must not be reading very well and I 
will be more perseptive in the fucher!

Mathew - most of use have given up on putting our keys in sigs, and are 
instead using our .plan files, or just putting something in our sig to the 
affect of 'PGP key available by request'.

I think it's nice to have a line in your sig to let others know that you are 
using pgp - perhaps it will encourage it's widespread use.

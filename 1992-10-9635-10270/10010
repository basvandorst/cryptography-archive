Sorry for the wide and dubious distribution of this request but
I couldn't find anywhere more appropraite.....

A friend who owns a small business is looking for low cost devices
for detecting the validity of paper currency.

He was told of a special pen which wrote
in one of two colours depending on the validity of the bill
(presumably reacting with paper/ink) this sounds like it would
be at the low-end of the scale to me.

Any ideas on how I could track down(for purchase) this or other
validators?

Thanks. (e-mail preferred, I can sumarize)

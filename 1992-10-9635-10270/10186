Sorry, this doesn't work because you can tell the illicit traffic from the legal
traffic unless you already have the keys.  Anyone wanting to send illicit
messages just registers any key and then uses a different key.  Unless you
have the key you can't tell if the registered key was used or not.  So
registering keys only allows you to read the traffic of those people with
nothing to hide, so why bother.

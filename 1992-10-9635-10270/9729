There's a commercial product from Racal which actually functions as a pocket
calculator until you activate it with your secret code. It will then work
out one-time passwords to let you into a system.

But the funniest covert function I came across was in one of the Olivetti
2000 series ATMs. There was a long keystroke sequence which would cause a
`test dispense', ie spit out 10 banknotes without your having to put in a
card or anything tedious like that.

One large, ponderous and bureaucratic banking organisation duly recorded
this fact in their branch operations manual. Nothing happened for three years
and then suddenly all the Olivetti ATMs in a particular town started going
out of balance.

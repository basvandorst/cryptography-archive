This is probably a FAQ, so let me apologize in advance.  The subject
line says it all. I'm "in the market" for a C source code
implementaion of the DES. I'm sure this is ftp'able from somewhere and
that the wise people that frequent this group can point me in the
right direction.  Email or post is fine.  Thanks

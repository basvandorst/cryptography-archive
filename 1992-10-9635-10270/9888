Few encryption systems have this property in general.  As I recall, the
system known as Bifid (see H. F. Gaines' Cryptanalysis for a brief
summary) has this property.  For a given keysquare and period, n is not
known, but is fixed for that particular set.

For other systems, this property seldom holds in general or for
specific keys.  The simplest way to show this is to do Simple Substitution
ciphers.  One can re-arrange the standard two alphabet key as
chains of substitutions.  For instance, consider (for brevity) the following
simple substitution key 

ABCDEFGHIJK...   for plaintext and
REPUBLICAND...   for ciphertext.

This has B->E->B (and hence, is B<->E), but G->I->A->R->morestuff->G.  This
sort of irregular value for n is commonplace in ciphers.

Simple substitution, in fact, does represent the general case.  Some number
of cipher and plaintext pairs will be each other's inverse, some will have
a third party inbetween, some a fourth, etc., thus taking on a wide variety
of values of n.  If one could make predictions about this, it might form
the basis of an attack.  However, except for degenerate forms of keys for
a given system (example:  REPUBLICAN... and YZREPUBLICAN... as the 
alphabets in simple substitution), I don't know of cases other than Bifid
where it might be useful and none offhand where the value of n is even uniform.

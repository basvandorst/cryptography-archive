The Wernsdorf paper [3] is the third paper in a series of results related to 
subgroup of permutations that can be generated by a class of product ciphers.

The first paper was by Coppersmith and Grossman [1] who showed that a simple 
set of round functions F could be used in a product cipher to generate the 
alternating group. Here "generate" means that if P is an element from the 
alternating group then there will exist an integer N_P such that the mapping 
induced by composing F with itself N_P times, denoted as F^{N_P}, will in 
fact be P. The relation between P and N_P was not given, ie. how large does 
N_P have to be before P is generated? Also the round function F was very 
general and the round function of DES was a special case of this F function.
(For DES the round function is the E expansion, the key XOR, S-box substi-
tution and transposition).

Even and Goldreich [2] modified the result of Coppersmith and Grossman so 
that it applied more to DES. Let a DES-like cipher be any product cipher 
that has the same structure as DES but may have a different round function.
Observe that LOKI is DES-like, while IDEA is not DES-like. Even and Goldreich 
proved that that if P is an element from the alternating group then there will 
exist an integer N_P such that N_P rounds of a DES-like cipher will induce a 
mapping that is P.

However they comment that some 64-bit permutations P will require 2^{32} 
rounds to be realized, ie. N_P = 2^{32}. Further, it is not clear how this
result relates to DES, since the number of rounds is restricted, and the 
set of possible round functions has size 2^{48} (one mapping for each subkey 
setting), while there are a possible 2^{32*2^{32}} round mappings.

The recent result of Wernsdorf is to show that these 2^{48} possible round 
mappings are not a restriction in the sense that they can also be used to 
generate the alternating group. Again there is the proviso that the number 
of rounds is unlimited.

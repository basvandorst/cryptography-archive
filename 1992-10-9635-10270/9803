Ref: Using CDs as a OTP

I like the idea, especially as my CD player has a digital output [ :-) ]

However, does the digitised music make a *good* random sequence?  Almost all
music has repetitive sequences in it, would this constitute enough of a
probelm to worry about??

Of course, there are certain problems.  For example, a Kylie Minogue CD
will yield n identical sequences where n is the number of tracks....

And, of course, it is well known that the KGB (or whatever they're called
this week) have been distributing truly random OTPs in the UK music market
for some time, they call it rave music...... :-)

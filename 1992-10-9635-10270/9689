In volume 2 of _The Art of Computer Programming_ (Semi-numerical Algorithms),
Knuth mentions a "interesting alternative to the RSA scheme" based on
C=M^2(mod x), which he calls a SQRT box.

It was developed by Micheal Rabin, and is described in [MIT Lab. for
Comp. Sc., report TR-212 (1979)].  I'd start by looking there, even
though the report is dated 1979, the concept may go back before 1977.

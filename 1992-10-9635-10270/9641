All this talk about total isolation and how the enemy can translate your
public keys given that all communication is trapped is a fine parlor game,
perhaps, but hardly relevant.

The criteria for trusted systems pay quite a lot of attention (perhaps more
than is deserved) to detecting and preventing covert channels.  It's a
*very* hard problem -- and that assumes that you have total ownership of
the computer system and all you're trying to prevent is communication from
within the one system -- and you're allowed to announce that you've forbidden
access -- and the user isn't allowed to complain.

To achieve complete spoofing of the kind being discussed here, it's not a
computer system for which covert channels are being prevented but a social
system and the enemy has to achieve it without letting anyone know that the
censor/intruder is active -- in a society in which free speech is a guaranteed
right, no less.

How about taking this discussion to alt.tv.mission.impossible?

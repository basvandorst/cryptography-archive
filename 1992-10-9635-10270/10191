	What I believe Mr. Fiedorwicz's meaning here is not "reductio ad
absurdum"; BUT more how absurd the whole idea of having "authority" or
goverment keeping tabs on crypto keys.  I mean really; what would I be
doing if I submitted my key to an authorised source that would keep it
secret until I did something that society didn't approve of.  Then my
goose would be cooked right?  I'm sorry but I really won't be participating
in any such activities.  I will still send my crypto-messages and codes
without any supervision.  I think that most people that feel that the
rights of the individual are priority #1. As long as they don't infringe
upon other peoples rights.

SO the questions I put is:

1. Does the fact that a person is using some form of cryptology make them
	suspect?

2. Does the federal goverment really think that their bureaucracy can keep
	up with technology?

3. If a person is really doing illegal activites that use cryptography wouldn't
	it(the activity) show other aspects that were also illegal?

"Partly it may be due to a phenomenon known since the very dawn of spaceflight
in connection with certain pharmaceutical drugs. They induced adverse
psychological effects, including radical changes of mood and personality.
However the fact that they were prescribed by a physician militated
against the patient's chance of deducing that they were the proximate cause
of his suffering; indeed, he would be more inclined to ask for further drugs
to counteract the first, and since the whole process was extremely profitable
for all concerned save the ultimate consumer, they would be provided.

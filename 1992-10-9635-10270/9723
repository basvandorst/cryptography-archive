You don't trust your calculator, do you??

You don't use a Japanese-manufactured one, do you??

You know that Japanese companies have conspirated to reprogram all
exported calculators to give wrong results that may be destroying the
Western civilization, don't you??

:-) :-) :-) :-)

[And of course, if you really like that conspiracy rubbish, you can
replace 'Japanese' by just everyone you want: the CIA, NSA, BND
(German version of the CIA), your system manager, my neighbour's dog
etc., as you know that - nobody knows the internals of his calculator
and - custom chips are widely available, even under the condition that
the design be kept secret under all cirumstances :-)]

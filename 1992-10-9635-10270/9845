I have heard that people in a certain government lab have reformatted a hard
disk three times (or written 1's and 0's over it three times) and still been
able to recover data.  So the official word at that facility is that if you
want to take a computer with a hard disk in it from a Secret area to a non-
Secret area, you have physically destroy the hard disk.

I personally have reformatted the ahrd disk on my Mac II, written 1's and 0's 
over the entire disk and then used a disk rescue program to recover recognia-
ble fragments of files.

In my opinion, once its written to disk it is there forever in one form or
another (and don't forget tape recorders, under some circumstances if you
erase an audio tape, you can recover fragments or even entire tracks of the
erased tape.  One Technician inLos Angeles was able to recover information
from an erassed vcr tape.)

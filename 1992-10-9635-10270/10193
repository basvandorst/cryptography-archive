         This is nonsense.  Organized crime is also based on things
like insurance fraud, bankruptcy fraud, loan fraud, theft rings,
monopolies maintained by illegal intimidation etc.  These are not
victimless and almost everyone is adversely affected directly or
indirectly.  I myself see little danger in widespread availability
of secure encryption systems, however you do your cause no good by
making ridiculous statements like organized crime has few victims.

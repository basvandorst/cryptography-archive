	I wouldn't believe the someone.  From your rather imprecise and 
	confusing definition, I would say it is probably "nearly trivial"
	to break.  If you like, email me (or post) your code for encryption
	and decryption, and I will comment further.

	Brief statement of why it is easy to break: you are repetatively 
	encoding segments with essentially the same key.  This makes it a 
	variant of a polyalphabetic cipher, which can be broken with a 
	decent sample and some sweat.

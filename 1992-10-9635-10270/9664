Since some discussions on trusting keys
are already in the group.

1) How could we set-up an certification authority
equivalent to RSA?

2) How could this be done in a cooperative way?

3) How americans could profit of it without breaking
patent laws?

4) What will be the problems of this certification
authority?

5) How can we do it FOR FREE (altough the US$25 
charged by RSA is not too much).

The PGP manual suggests a "guerrila" style CA, but this
really means no CA, but just friend to friend trust.
If we want to have other uses for PGP, like certifying
software is not infected, we must trust someone that
is probably not a friend or a friend of a friend.

     Cheers,

             Jerry

Someone here asked about Snefru.  Biham and Shamir's differential
cryptanalysis was ableto crack Snefru with two passes in minutes.
Details are in the various papers (and presumably the book when it
comes out).

Eli Bihman received the prize from Ralph Merkle at a Crypto rump
session, either 1989 or 1990 (I forget).

There are several reasons why the nazi's were so succesful in deporting jews
from the Netherlands in 40-45. One of them was that the netherlands had
installed in the 30's an almost perfect registration of the population.

At that time, the prospect of it being misused was dim.

I don't think that registering your keys now will have very grave results in
the US. But in 10 or 20 years you suddenly might find yourself under a
militarist-like government (who knows? it cannot happen? That's what they said
about Lebanon (Switzerland of the Middel East) also.)

While registering now might have good results when fighting crime, it might
backlash in as little as 20 years from now.

(The war history is now one of the reasons that the Dutch are in general very
sensitive about identification cards etc.)

For cryptographic purposes this might very well be adequate, although there
is still the need to physically exchange the disks.  For mathematical 
purposes, the rate is far too low, and the quality may be too poor as
well.  There are biases due to the fact that reading and switching can
occur simultaneously, and it is doubtful if these biases can be  made
small enough.  It is also impossible to test accurately enough, so that
this would require using multiple bits at different times for good random
output.

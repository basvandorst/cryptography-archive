It's surprising that no one has mentioned the immune system here.
Generating a zillion variant cells which make a zillion variant
antibodies, apparently at random, is just what makes it possible to
respond to antigens that haven't been invented yet.  And we've mostly
solved the compare-the-results problems, though people suffering from an
auto-immune disease may take exception.  None this proves that you could
attack decryption this way, but it's a sort of existence proof.

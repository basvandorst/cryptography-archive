Gee Willie, I've used my guns to kill innumerable paper targets, a few
hundred steel silhouette critters, thousands of tin cans and a few 
game animals.  I have also used it once (without firing) to chase away
a carjacker.  If a gun is "only used to kill lots of innocent people",
how come I can do all these things?

Yep, we're the lone cowboys the world runs to when they get their asses
in the wringer.

You are blind.  Both firearms and personal crypto are means of thwarting
government opression and empowering the individual.

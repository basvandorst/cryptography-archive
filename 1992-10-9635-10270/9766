	- then use Fermat's theorem 4 times
	  (Fermat's theorem:  if  b**(n-1) != 1 (mod n), then
	  'n' cannot be a prime. This requires that 'b' and 'n'
	  are relatively prime.)

In all the numbers less than 10^12 (or something like that), 
the Fermat test using b=2 will fail (i.e., give a false positive
reading) for only 15000 numbers.  Thats 15000 out of 10^12!  Thats
like 1 in 10^8, which are worse odds than you winning the lottery!

Now, if you iterate this four times, you increase your odds,
probabalistically, of having a good number.  Yes, you do have to
worry about the Carmichael numbers (since there are an infinity of
them), however there are far fewer Carmichael numbers than there
are primes.

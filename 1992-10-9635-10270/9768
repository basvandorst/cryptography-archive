My hard drive crashed (actually, the stoned virus and Stacker ate it.) So
I have not returned any messages about keys, or anything else actually.  I
will have to download PGP again and generate a new key.  I'm sorry if I 
annoyed anyone with this but there was not much I could do about it.

This is what I get for FTP'ing stuff for people on my PC.

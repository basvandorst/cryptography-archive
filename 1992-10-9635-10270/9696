   I'm suspicious - this looks like Someone is circulating a rather
   crudely hacked version of the program. Or am I being overly paranoid?

No, you are being just-about-right paranoid, but I'll bet if you get
PKUNZIP release 1.10 instead of whatever you've used to date, you'll
find it works better. I had the above problem with PKUNZIP 1.01.

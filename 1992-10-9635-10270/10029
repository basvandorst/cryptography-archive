In discussing this with an an attorney acquaintance with experience
on the FBI side, his immediate and cynical response to the idea of
court-ordered protection of privacy was generally as follows:

  1)  Law enforcement people routinely violate the court-order
      restriction and wiretap;
  2)  Via the wiretap, they learn of some other evidence they can
      collect of an illegal activity;
  3)  Using the fruits of step 2, they appear before a court and
      obtain the court order, omitting the fact that the fruits of
      step 2 were obtained by the illegal act of step 1, and
  4)  Voila! a court-ordered wiretap!

For the readership of this group, it is superfluous to point out
that this abhorrent practice has nothing to do with being pro-crime
or anti-crime.  It does have to do with the idea that the government
shouldn't break laws it expects the citizenry to obey - any laws
whatsoever.  The rule of law, and no person being above it, is one
of the most basic tenets of American society.

So why give (probably) well-meaning law enforcement people the means
to commit such a criminal sequence of acts?

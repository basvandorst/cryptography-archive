If you are referring to the simple frequency of letters in the
American English, her are the first few off-hand. I don't remember all
of them.
e t a o n r i s h d l u c 
(handy during Wheel of Fortune)

The most common 1-letter words are a and I.

The most common 2-letter words are:
ad am an as at 
be by do go he 
id if in is it 
me no of on or 
ox so up us we

I won't go any further by memory, but if you desire, e-mail me and I
could probably get information on common 3,4,5, and maybe 6-letter
words.

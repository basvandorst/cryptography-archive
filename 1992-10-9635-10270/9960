I would like my cryptography book to have a good annotated bibliography of
books and articles on the topic.  To that end, I am soliciting suggestions
for books and articles in include.

I am not just interested in general books on the topic, but particularly
lucid articles on subtopics as well.  For example, someone recently mentioned
a very good introductory article on the subject of zero-knowledge proofs.  
Garey & Johnson's _Computers_and_Intractability_ is an excellent introduction
to complexity theory.  Diffie's "The First Ten Years of Public Key 
Cryptography" (Proceedings of the IEEE, v. 76, n. 5, May 88, pp. 560-577) is
a very enjoyable read, as are many of Chaum's papers in CACM and some of G.
Simmons' writings.  I am looking for more suggestions along those lines.

I will summarize the results both here and in the book.

Bruce

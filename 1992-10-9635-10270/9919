Oddly enough, this idea hasn't only been thought of before, but it actually
made it into a professional journal:

	Jean-Jacques Quisquater and Yvo G. Desmedt, "Chinese Lotto as an
	Exhaustive Code-Breaking Machine," COMPUTER, Nov 91, pp. 14-22.

It's amazig how thing they're slicing the stuff these days.

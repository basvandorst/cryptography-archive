I hear about people who say "Don't let them take away our rights," but
referring to people that were elected; and there is the constant "we-them"
regarding 'who is government and who is governed,' although I thought
it's supposed to be a 'gummint ... of ... the people' (?)

Map that onto this:  I used to spend a lot of time talking to my best
friend about how my marriage sucked.  I was told (after enough bitching
on my part), "Either do something about it, or quit bitching about it."

I hope my ex-wife is as happy as I am.

So, my point, Chris, is this:  If you have chosen to approve of
the method of selecting the government under which you are subject, 
either live with it or change it; if you have let it be selected without
your influence, you have chosen to live with it; and if you are sitting 
around as a spectator, then you should be very careful where you cast 
stones.

"Either do something about it, or quit bitching about it [keeping the
government honest]."

Only an opinion.

Regards,

Dave

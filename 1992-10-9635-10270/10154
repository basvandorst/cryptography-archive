The other problem with warrants in this context is that they are
usually obtained secretly and have a limited scope.  Once the
warrant expires, who will either guarantee that the owner of the
key is notified so that he or she may change the key, or ensure
that the authority given access to the owner's secret key
destroys their copy of it so they cannot read future mail?

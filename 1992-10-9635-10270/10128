eh? how would this miracle be accomplished? even with
registered keys, law enforcement won't get the ciphertext of
communications without tapping or monitoring of some sort.
the key alone gives you nothing. even if they could criminals
will just use unregistered keys. that just gives the justice
system another charge to use against criminals, as well as
anyone 'they' don't happen to like but is otherwise innocent.

Okay, this is the second time I've heard this, and it doesn't make
sense to me.  I thought Diffie and Hellman invented (and published)
public-key cryptography before RSA was invented?  Do I have a
misunderstanding (feel free to correct me), or is it just PKC that
is based on the difficulty of factoring that is covered by the PKP
patent?  (Or did I misidentify the patent number above?)

You have reinvented the one-time pad, which is extremely well-known and is,
as you realized, unbreakable if the key is kept secret.  You are exactly
right in all of your analysis, and your suggestion of a pair of CDs-full 
of random data is also well-known and on target.

So congratulations for getting it right, and a small kick in the pants for
not looking it up in a book on cryptography (virtually any such book will 
have a discussion of one-time pads).

This sounds like a "The ends justifies the means," argument.  Putting aside
my philosophical objections to such justifictions, I see that the issue is
really a double-edged sword.  You argue that regulation of cryptography
will be a good thing because it will prevent crime and terrorism and that
the cost to individuals in terms of lost privacy will be small.  I'm not
convinced.  And furthermore, with a government that has repeatedly shown
itself to be completely devoid of any sense of ethics (must I provide
examples?), I am loathe to give them the power to read communications I
consider important enough to bother encrypting.

If laws restricting the use of cryptography by the public or similar laws
compromising one's right to privacy are allowed to pass, a dangerous prec-
edent will be set.  How long will it be before we will all be required to
have hidden microphones and cameras in our residences justified by the aid
they will give law enforcement in preventing crime?  Sure, there will prob-
ably be intermediate steps between the regulation of cryptography and cam-
eras in our homes, but who wants to risk going down that path?  Not me!

Unfortunately, given the apathetic nature of most Americans, it is unlikely
that any serious opposition will be able to be mounted against this, or
other threats to our privacy.  And even if people did care, many of them
would agree with Dorothy.  People today seem more concerned with their own
security than with their liberties.  Benjamin Franklin wrote, "They that
can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety deserve
neither liberty nor safety."  Too bad so few contemporary Americans share
this sentiment.

It is as ungrounded as your earlier assertion that electronic surveillance
results in savings of billions of dollars (to whom?) is.

I will first admit that I am unfamiliar with the details of the FBI wiretap
bill they keep trying to get congress to pass, but wasn't it supposed to
give them the ability to wiretap anyones phone (and other forms of elec-
tronic communications) anywhere, anytime, without the consent of the tel-
ephone company?  If this is the case, do you really think a court order
will be waited for before eavesdropping occurs?

Let's hope that this will create a market for enterprising individuals
to do business by removing the achilles heel from such products.

Perhaps not.  But I agree with Jefferson when he said, "That government
is best which governs least."

I, for one, assert my right to privacy, including my right to encipher
communications to whomever I wish in a form that to the best of my know-
ledge can not be intercepted and decoded by any other than the intended
recipient.

Thank you for writing, "Cryptography and Data Security."  I'll look
forward to a new edition -- assuming I can legally buy it by the time
it comes out!

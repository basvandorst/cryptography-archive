If you have an on-line copy of the dictionnary, then you can do the
following:

  grep -i e /usr/dict/words | wc

... to find how many words contain the letter 'e'.  You can do this for all
26 letters.  This is the results I got with a dictionary of 25144 words:

   a   13190
   b    3862
   c    7204
   d    5324
   e   14835
   f    2342
   g    3756
   h    4844
   i   11428
   j     427
   k    1848
   l    8625
   m    5320
   n   10256
   o   10285
   p    4929
   q     377
   r   11533
   s    8700
   t   10599
   u    5989
   v    1848
   w    1907
   x     616
   y    3523
   z     380

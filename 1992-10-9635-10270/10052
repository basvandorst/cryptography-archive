My enhanced RANGER Device meets the critical features# 1, 3, 6 (cost,
connectivity, and performance) as follows:
1.  The parts cost is less than $40 (you can build it yourself).
2.  Based on jitter from 16 crystal oscillators instead of alpha rays.
3.  Connects to the PC's parallel port.
4.  8"x10" Printed Circuit Board using off-the-shelf components
    (could no doubt be reduced with surface-mount or other packaging)
5.  Powered by a single 5Volt 1Amp encapsulated power supply.
6.  Considerably faster: approximately 6,750 random bits per second.

Additionally, billions of the bits were tested -- and passed --
the statistical tests outlined in Knuth's _The Art of Computer Programming_,
Volume 2 (Seminumerical Algorithms) -- as implemented in my RANDTEST
program (Volume 1 Number 3).

Details, including Printed Circuit Board (PCB) artwork included in
_Cryptosystems Journal_ Volume 2 Number 2 (June 1992).

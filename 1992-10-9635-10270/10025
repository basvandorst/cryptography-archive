I've noticed that all the discussion of computerized cryptography
seems to assume that one should use a byte-by-byte approach, i.e.
take one byte of plaintext, encrypt it, output it, and repeat.
Wouldn't it also be possible and perhaps desirable to automate
other approaches, such as a word-by-word approach?  e.g. have a
dictionary file containing all likely words, and replace each
word with a 4-byte integer; plus some kind of substitution cipher
to handle proper nouns, numerals and other things that aren't
in the dictionary.  If the codebreakers intercepting a message
encrypted in this manner assumed it was byte-by-byte encoded,
they'd never be able to decrypt it.  How secure would such a
scheme be?

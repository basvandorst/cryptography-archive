This is a wonderful quote, but I don't see liberty and safety as opposites.  
If I can't walk through some park, say, without a reasonable expectation of
safety, I lose some liberty to move about freely.  Maybe women are 
more sensitive to this than men because we are more vulnerable.  As 
another example, if we as a society don't give up the liberty to kill 
whomever we want or take whatever we want, we also relinquish the 
liberty to live without complete fear of being killed or ripped off.
Society is a contract which requires a lot of give and take.

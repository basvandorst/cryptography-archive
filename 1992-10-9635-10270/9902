	Indeed, error rates in biological systems are of the order
	of 10^-9 - 10^-12 per generation.  Mutagenesis ups the error rate
	and kills the beast more often than not (except when you have silent
	substitutions).  So, at 10^8 bugs/mL, needing 10^9 mutants at
	a mutation frequency of 10^-9, you need 10^8 mL, or 10^5 L to
	get all your variants.  You can get about 1 mL of this on a
	Petri dish to screen for your mutant so you need 10^8 Petri
	dishes with a vol. of 50 mL or, 500,000 litres of Petri dishes.
	With practice, you can innoculate 5 plates/min so the whole thing
	would take 2.10^7 min or about 100 manyears. Piece of cake, now
	to screen them.

	Mechanistically, it's a little more limited than zillions
	(trillions is a possibility).

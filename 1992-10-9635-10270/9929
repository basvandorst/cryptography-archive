     True, and moreover, it varies greatly with your source of text,
and the biases it contains.  The classic WWII crypto frequency table
(and I think Poe's, too, although from a much earlier era) was based
on a sample of telegrams, and thus the letters AEHT were under-
represented since writers of telegrams tend to omit the articles "THE"
and "A" to cut cost.  Using computer-text about computers would be
representative only for such text; our techno-babble has a skewed
distribution.  Depending on your purpose, you may need to statistically
analyze the kind of text to which you plan to apply the statistics.
    Characther and Digraph counts take from online dictionaries are
even more skewed, since (as as been previously noted) most do endings
on the fly, do not indicate word frequency of use so rare words get
equal weight with common, and in particular the Unix standard
dictionary from Bell labs has a lot of techno babble content -- so
much so that a nonsense word generator (using digraph/trigraph
frequencies) that used the same Bell-unix dictionary, /usr/dict/words,
of which Craig displayed the monograph counts, created words that
sounded rather germanic.

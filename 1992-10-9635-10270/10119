Overheard in St. Petersburg (Not Florida):

"Alexei, can you believe that in the United States the people must _register_
their keys so the authorities can read their communications? I am so
glad we live here."

Perry's point about the parallels with strict gun control echo my own
concerns. Because of fears of what crimes _some_ people may commit,
basic rights are taken away. 

: (Gawd, I feel like Cassandra here. Is anyone listening?)

Yeah, I'll bet a lot of folks at NSA, FINCEN (Financial Crimes
Enforcement Network), DEA, State, CIA, and the FBI are reading these
posts. What we are doing by protesting these trial balloons is
alerting them to the level of anger. And we're potentially upsetting
the tidy little plan to place "reasonable" restrictions on our
pricacy. 

(If I suddenly get an IRS audit, due to my postings about black
markets and anonymous information markets, I'll let you folks know. No
smiley this time.)

It means neither of them.  Only two DES keys are used, let's call them
A and B.  Triple DES encryption is performed like this: encrypt message
with A, decrypt with B, encrypt again with A.

If the two keys A and B are identical, then a triple DES encryption is
equivalent to a single DES encryption using either of the keys.

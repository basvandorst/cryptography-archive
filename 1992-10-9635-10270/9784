Hi,

  Curious ...

  Now with DES having been "decertified", and newer NIST certified
single key encryption scheme not yet around any corner ...

  What encryption scheme is the most popular in ...

  1. Financial sector, such as Inter Bank Transactions ?
  2. On networks like SWIFT ?
  3. Trade and commerce, such as between stock brokers and
       their major clients ?
  4. Within Private Corps, and also within (branches of) same banks ?

Is DES still the most prevalant method, simple because of a large
installed base already existing ?

(I am new to this group, and the subject, tho' aware of the issues
in cryptography, but new to the state-of-art ... I will be grateful
for all answers, E-mail or post here.)

  Also, the new NIST DSS standard .. is it seeing any field use
are any commercial/legally-binding application using (too early ?)
or intending to use it ?

  Also related issue, ...

  with so much hue and cry being raised today over privacy issues
in public telecom, and tapping of cellular phones .. I wonder
if some group is looking into adaptation of any digital encryption
schemes, esp. two key schemes for cellular phone use, esp the
newer digital cellular phone standards. 

  One would not need a "very strong" encryption scheme here, but it
surely must be very cheap to implement in $100 phones in a competitive
market. And if it is a two key scheme, so much the better.

I noticed one small problem with the Amiga PGP binary.  On my unaccelerated
A2000, it's very easy to outrun the keyboard-timing routines when the program
asks for "random input".  

I haven't taken a close look at the source code for keyboard timing, but
when I did an experimental port of PGP for the DICE compiler under 1.3, I
also had the same problem.

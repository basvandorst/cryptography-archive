But how many times, say in the last 200 years, have guns be used against
government oppression in the USA, compared to being used to shoot innocent
people?
Maybe in the Civil War by the Southerns? But then they did not succeed.

I think comparing cryptography to guns is counterproductive, as it may give
people the impression that cryptography's main use is to hurt other people.

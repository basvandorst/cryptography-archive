    I'm not sure if this has been gone over before in these groups but I need
help with the algorithm that is used to compute the checksum field in a
Video Cipher authorization number. The number are 12 hex digits and look like
this
             029b 7b0c ff09
Supposedly the second last byte, FF, is an error flag for the board and the
last byte, 09, is the actual checksum calculated from the previous bytes.

   I've tried the two checksum algorithms that I'm familiar with and they
didn't work. While I'm sure the algorithm isn't too hard its the old story 
of not being able to find enough time to look at it, so if anyone knows 
it I'd like to avoid reinventing the wheel. Or even if you just have pointers
please mail me. Thanks.

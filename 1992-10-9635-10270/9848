Quoting from a paper by Ekert and some others:

"According to quantum theory ..[making a copy of the carrier of information]...
cannot in general be completed. Quantum cloning will give a positive result
leaving the state of the original intact only if the adversary knows in advance
that the carrier of information is in a quantum state picked from a particular
set of orthonormal states."

This would seem to rule out the possibility of eavesdropping by cloning.

I'm no expert on this: perhaps someone out there who is could give the last
word?

This "contest" came out shorty after the first release of my
zipcrack program about 8 months ago.  Unfortuantely the whole
thing has been done in ways that make it a waste of time to
bother with, regardless of the strength of the encryption
algorithm.

   1) the encrypted file was not compressed by PKZIP.  The first bytes
          of compressed files are generally predictable, which is probably
          why it isn't compressed.  Since PKZIP is a fairly good
          compressor, a file that cannot be compressed probably contains
          mostly unidentifiable junk.  PKWARE rejected my requests for 
          information about the file's contents, chosen plaintext, 
          additional ciphertext, etc. 

   2) only one file is provided, in ciphertext only.

   3) There is no way to know when you've found the correct password.
          Sure, the CRC of the output needs to match the one in the
          archive, but that isn't of much use with anything other than
          brute-force (see below).

   4) although the contest was released to answer concerns about the
          vulnerability of PKZIP encryption to brute-force attacks,
          it has been carefully designed to prevent brute-force attacks,
          as their 7-digit password contains *any* of the 256 ASCII
          characters.  Somehow I doubt many users actually pick passwords
          from the extended character set...

The latest release of my Zipcrack program (I think I released it around
June of this year) used a highly-optimized brute-force algorithm that
can test over 100,000 passwords/second on my 80386-33.  Because brute-
force can be done so quickly, I would not recommend the PKZIP encryption
to protect sensitive information.

If you would like to get a uuencoded copy of zipcrack, let me know and
I'll mail you one if you are in the USA.  Because exporting the program
may be a violation of US law, I'm afraid I can't send it to non-US sites.
Please note that the publicly-available version will only search for
passwords beginning with the letter 'Z' and requires an 80386 or above.
I have midterms on Monday and Tuesday, so it may take me a while to
reply if I get many requests.

Sincerely,
Paul Kocher

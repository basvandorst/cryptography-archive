In my quest to find info about crypt I have found many
different *fast* crypt algorithms, and one implimentation
of the good old slow one.  However I cannot seem to find 
a *description* of the algorithm.   Does anyone know of one
on-line somewhere?

Or maybe a reference to a book or article?

Thanks,
Pat

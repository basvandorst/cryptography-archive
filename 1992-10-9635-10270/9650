I'll agree with that. Terry seems to me to be saying,"It's a good system but
there are weaknesses.  What are you going to use it for?"

In the PGP Phil Z compares encrypted e-mail to the envelope we use for letters.
Well, you can steam letters open; put medicinal alcohol on them and make them
transparent; poke in a split stick, wind the letter round it, remove the letter
read it and put it back.  Should we give up using envelopes?

(I hope I didn't tell you something you didn't already know there)

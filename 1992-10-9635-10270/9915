    {\bf `The One-round Functions of DES Generate the Alternating Group'}

    Each round of DES consists of $2^{48}$ permutations. The group which they
    generate is shown to be 3-transitive, and if this were not equal to
    $A_{2^{64}}$, then it would have a unique minimal normal subgroup which is
    Abelian or simple. The former is excluded by displaying a permutation with
    too many fixed points, and the latter by the classification theory of
						 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    simple groups.
    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^

my god... monsters, moonshine, and DES.... I wonder if the DES
designers could have anticipated this, but it's getting off the subject...

Thanks for the reference, now I need to try to get hold of the paper.

This may be a dumb question, but does the one-round functions
generating the alternating group imply that DES *itself* generates the
A_(2^64)?  Or could the 16 one-round functions that make up
DES, because they cannot be chosen independently, always happen when
composed together to make elements of some subgroup of A^(2_64)?
Thanks again.

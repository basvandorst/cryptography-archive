Subject: where is everything?!?
Lines: 12

I'm looking for any kind of en/de-cryption programs.
I knoe that everyone keeps asking for FTP sites, but no one posts it up where
everyone can see it.
Please e-mail me any FTP sites with cryption stuff on them--
then post it on the net for any other newcomers.
your help is, of course, appreciated.
Thanx in advance.

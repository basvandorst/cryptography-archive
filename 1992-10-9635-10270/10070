Professor Denning's proposals for encryption key registration 
have inspired me to advance my own ideas for hastening the
onset of a brave new world (lamentably already 8 years overdue).

Why not install video cameras in every home?  They could be tied
into existing cable television systems.

Of course we must safeguard the privacy of ordinary law-abiding
citizens.  So we require that law enforcement agencies obtain
a court order before they can remotely activate these video
cameras.  If more privacy should be required, video scramblers
can be connected (whose encryption keys are properly registered
with a trustworthy neutral agency).

The benefits of such a proposal are obvious and indisputable.
Heinous criminal activity will be strongly discouraged. Family
values will be improved.  The national moral fiber will be
enhanced.

Tongue firmly in cheek,

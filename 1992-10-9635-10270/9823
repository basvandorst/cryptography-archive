Just a sidenote to 'Hackers' words...

  There are also encryption algorithms that when used to encrypt the 
plaintext over and over and over, will yield the un-encrypted text. (Ie: 
Its a circular encryption -- Sorry, I don't know the correct term here)

Also, the reasons for tinkerig with DES could possibly be for one reason, 
it was claimed 'unreversable' (Right?) and also that its the basis for 
Unix' CRYPT().

What good would this do?  If I'm a criminal and I'm intelligent enough
to encrypt my data, I'm intelligent enough to use an unregistered key.
If the court order comes down I'm charged with using an unregistered key
instead of whatever I would have been charged with.  This is just another
case of restricting the law abiding citizen while having no affect on
criminals.

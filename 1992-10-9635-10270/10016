I think that the thing that really concerns me here is that the general
public is completely unwarare of the issue and its importance, despite the
fact that through services like Compuserve and Prodigy email is becoming
more and more prevalent.

Does anyone else think that it might be a good idea to draft a document
that describes what's at stake and includes a specific call to action
(write your congressman, or something like that?)  Such a document could
be posted all over the net, in newsgroups that don't specifically deal
with secruity/privacy/encryption issues, as well as in conspicuous places
on Compuserve and Prodigy.

I think that if people knew what was going on, they'd be upset.

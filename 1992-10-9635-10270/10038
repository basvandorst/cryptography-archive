I was, as I'm sure many others were, very concerned by what I read in Mr.
May's article.  But it seems to me that if we are opposed to those types
of restrictions placed on private communications, then we ought to try to
do something about it.

Does anyone know if there are any consumer or political groups in
existance who would be interested in this issue?  Has anyone tried to get
in touch with Common Cause, for example?  Or tried to organize a letter
writing campaign?

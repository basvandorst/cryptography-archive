Obviously one way that messages could be intercepted is by tapping off
of a line (phone or RS232) between a terminal and the mainframe it is
connected to....no doubt this is part of the reason why PGP is discouraged
on mainframe systems.

Wasn't there some mention a while back of "secure" terminal-to-mainframe
session software (I vaguely recall KA9Q tcp/ip ....) ?  It seems to me
that transferring session keys for securing a terminal line would be
easiest using public-key cryptography.

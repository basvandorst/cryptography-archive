Couldn't agree more.

This I disagree with. The file is made with PKZIP 1.10. A trick is used
to prevent compression. The file is compressed with -es. Due to the nature
of the file it didn't compress with Shrinking so the compressor chose
store.

[some points I agree with]

If the password is long enough the encryption seems safe (like with all
compression thats the best you can get). IMO the documentation is the real
problem. And it would be niced if the program warned in case of bad
passwords.

The industry had their chance earlier this year, and they blew it. The
IS-54B standard for digital cellular includes an "encryption" scheme
that is a complete farce. A fixed "mask", XORed with each vocoder
frame for the entire duration of each call...

The main culprit is, of course, the NSA. They let it be known, quietly
but firmly, that under no circumstances would they approve export of
any phones or phone designs with real security. Since most cell phones
are now made overseas, it's not hard to see how this influenced the
industry's standards.

The public is to blame, too, because they don't seem to care much. The
manufacturers are after all in business to make money, and without
a strong call for security from their customers they didn't have much
incentive to buck the NSA.

Congress, for its part, has just passed a law to ban the manufacture
or import of "scanning receivers" that can pick up cellular calls.
You can probably guess exactly how effective this will be.

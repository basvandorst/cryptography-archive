Netters,

I'm developing a product in which I wish to make many different
checksum and digest algorithms available to the user. As a result, I
intend to enumerate and implement all commonly known and used checksum
and digest algorithms. I am very interested in:

   * Any information on checksum and digest algorithms.
   * Any source code for these algorithms (preferably C).
   * The algorithms used in the "standard" checksum utilities
     of common operating systems (MS-DOS, Unix, VMS, Mac).
   * Any checksum/digest standards that might exist.

If it's about checksums and digests, I want to know about it!

I can access FTP sites.

Please mail all replies (and requests for summaries of what people
send me) direct to the address below. Unless you state otherwise,
replying will constitute permission for me to include your reply in a
summary which I may make public at a later date.

Thanks for your help,

Ross Williams

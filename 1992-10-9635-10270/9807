Absolutely correct, unless you get official permission for the export.

Correct again.

It's the same with DES.  Mustn't export DES from the US.

Mantis uses DES in its software.  I have both the ANSI and military DES
specifications.

Silly, huh?

If you do, you'll find that they already have DES and RSA.  I've chatted to
people in Russia who use PGP.  Basically, the US government's export controls
have been completely ineffective at stopping cryptographic technology from
leaving the US.

However, they do mean that no US company that might compete with Mantis can
use DES or RSA in products it ships to Europe.  Neat, huh?

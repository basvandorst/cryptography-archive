Carl Kadie posts an excerpt from the American Library Association's
statement on confidentiality of personal information which contains
the assertion: "the preservation of First Amendment rights, rights
which extend also to foreign nationals while in the United States."

I'm curious. Is the statement that First Amendment rights extend
to foreign nationals while in the United States an assertion,
or a legally validated principle (upheld by specific court
tests)?

Does anyone have any references?

David

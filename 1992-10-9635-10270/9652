I'm just getting started in studying cryptology but it seems to me that
the magnitude of such a message would outweigh any advantage gained by
do it.  Also every spy would have to be well versed in theology, which
has taken some people a life time in itself, in order to know which
sins are and which sins are not in the Bible.  While I'm in a low flame
mode how about problems that would arise from using different versions
of the Bible?

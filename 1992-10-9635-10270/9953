For people on UUCP systems with access to internet E-mail but
not FTP, you can try to get PGP 2.0 via email from:

listserv@spectrx.saigon.com  (Spectrox List Server)

Send a statement:

/PDGET  /public/msdos/pgp20.zip [UUENCODE | XXENCODE]

This is a small DOS Waffle machine in San Jose, CA (not Vietnam).
The list server will probably accept return addresses outside
the USA, "but that would be wrong" [R. Nixon].

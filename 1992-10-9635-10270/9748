A real computer virus, eh?  The difficult part is to gen up an enzyme
that generates _random_ numbers, represented as e.g. random proteins.
(OK, I'm not sure getting a bacterium to do DES is really that
straightforward either, but ....)  Enzymes like to always do the same thing.
The obvious approach is to use mutations to create the randomness,
but the mutagen would also presumably affect the compare-the-results genes.
So you've now got a very large number of very small monkeys typing away,
and another crowd of monkeys randomly yelling "This stuff is Shakespeare!" :-)

This reminds me of the case of the German crypto operator who only ever
used two synchronising sequences - HITLER or his girlfriend's name (which
I forget!).  Apparently he was taken prisoner by the 8th Army, and when the
crypto guys found out, the 8th had to go to *amazing* lengths to let him
escape!!!!

Well, the U-boats (and some of the other naval ops) used a machine with an
extra disc.  And as far as some codes that wer *never* broken, don't be too
sure, as we don't have an FOIA over here (UK).  My father knew one of the 
Bletchley park people and only found out 3 years ago that he was involved!

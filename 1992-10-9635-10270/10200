This is kind of a red herring, Dorothy.  To me (and Carl, and I suspect many
other civil libertarians) the issue is not whether the govt *does* tap without
court orders (which as you say, would require some proof, not just allegation)
but rather that they currently have the ability to do so without accountability.
I agree wholeheartedly with Carl about the risks.  Yes, it would be nice to be
able to do something about organized crime, drug dealers, etc, but if the cure
is worse than the disease, it probably isn't worth it.  If anyone wants an
excellent (and chilling) portrayal of a near-worst case scenario similar to
this, read "Shockwave Rider" by John Brunner.  It's a science-fiction story
about a near-future society in which almost everything has been computerized -
and the average citizen's rights have virtually ceased to exist, because of
these (and other) risks.

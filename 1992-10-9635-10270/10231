Since the US has the habit in trying to export its views all over the world
through economic pressure, it is not(*). And besides: since when are opinions
irrelevant because of people's origins, age, sex, or whatever? This statement
is not very tolerant, to say the least. Your message is in conflict with your
method, something normally found in extremist views.

(*) For instance Bulgary was pressured by the US to change its laws on
software copyrights and patents that way.

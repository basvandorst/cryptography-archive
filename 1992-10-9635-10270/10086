I just bought a copy at Computer Literacy in Sunnyvale.  Sixty bucks
(ouch).  It's a very good book but I've gotta say, you'll have to
be a real crypto history/war story buff to think it's worth dropping
that much cash.  There's not much technical info about any modern
crypto systems in it.

I hear there was a paperback edition that was somewhat abridged.
That's the one I would go for if I could find it.  Yes, I wish it wasn't
abridged, but there was quite a lot of stuff in the book that wasn't
essential.

You might also look for "Alan Turing, the Enigma" and "The Ultra Secret"
if you're interested in the history of WW2 cryptanalysis.

Well, this is probably too basic for sci.crypt and cross-posting
to alt.security *and* alt.security.pgp doesn't make much sense to
me so follow-ups have been directed to only alt.security.pgp.

Doesn't reusing the (encrypted) bit mask make long messages fairly
easy to crack if you have ideas as to the content of the plain text?
I guess the message would best be several times the length of the
bit mask for this to work.

Is it done this way to save computation time when en/decrypting?
Or is this to get around silly NSA restrictions?

Thanks,

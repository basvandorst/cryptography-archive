	I'm just wondering. What kinds of techniques are usually used for
synching two crypto streams? Suppose I have a pair of boxes that each can
talk DES. There is a wire between them. I want to pass data back and
forth encrypted. What kinds of tricks might I use to get them both talking
together (and able to understand eachother) ;) without having to pass some
kind of a key over the wire that an enemy could use?

	This seems to me to be a pretty hard problem to solve, but if I'm
not mistaken there are boxes out there that do exactly this. Or do they
just assume that the bag guys didn't manage to tap the first few packets
that go back and forth? Do they somehow save state between calls?

	It is important to focus on writing software that is "adequate."
Having one's software be "good" or even "excellent" is over-rated. If
"good" were necessary or even important, DOS would not be the de facto
standard operating system.                          -notebooks of a heretic

GSM pan European Celluar networks will operate over the whole of Europe
eventually. There are small pilot schemes running in most EC countries,
with Germany leading the way with two companies operating fledgling
commercial networks. The GSM standard calls for digital encryption of the
voice channels. Note that this is not new for Europe, the existing analogue
system in Germany is also encrypted. I believe that when implemented the
GSM encryption will exist from the customers handset to the mobile switch.
Beyond the switch is the normal telecom network. PCM traffic on this network
is not (usually) encrypted though the amount of access and expensive equipment
needed to intercept communication on these links will be outside the capabilities of all but governments.

Why write steady 0's and 1's ? Fight fire with fire !!

Should it not make better sense to write white noise, preferably
from a real white noise source, or perhaps a really long PRNG
or (why not !) a DES encoded version of a bunch of X-windows
programs XORed together would serve as an approximation to
a One time tape.

I am assuming that the recovery is from the small amounts of magnetic
transition that still remain even after cycling thru the hysterisis
loop three times. By writing blank 0's and 1's we are only
reducing the contrast between bits. By writing white noise we'd
be adding a lot of spurious noise which will swamp the signal.

The only way to recover would be the kind of techniques used to
recover radar signals bounced off venus, which are buried below
the SNR. -- namely correlation. But to correlate you'd
need either the original information (if only you had that
here in this case to begin with :-) or long sample times
compared to noise (not true here, since noise recorded is of same
granularity as the original information).

Only technique would need to correlate out the pseudo-white
noise we recorded on ... that X11 program that was used 
for instance .. but you have such a large variety to choose
from.

Oh, well you could use a days output from USENET instead ...
thats a lot of white noise :-)

Well, even seriously, compressed and DES encoded USENET dumps
should make a fairly good white noise source.

I wonder why this has not come up yet ... I admit I am
a novice to cryptography ... am I missing something ?

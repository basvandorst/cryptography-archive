   In my quest to find info about crypt I have found many
   different *fast* crypt algorithms, and one implimentation

   a *description* of the algorithm.   Does anyone know of one
   on-line somewhere?

   Or maybe a reference to a book or article?

Did you want a description of Unix crypt(3), or of DES itself? The
former can be had from Spafford and Garfinkel's excellent _Practical
Unix Security_, the latter from FIPS Pubs 46-1 (and two supplementary
pubs which I think are numbered 75 and 81 on how to use the algorithm
-- pardon the armwaving, I just moved and my books are boxed).

There is also a discussion of DES in Seberry and Pieprzrk,
_Cryptography: An Introduction to Computer Security_, Prentice Hall
1989.

"What does it mean by _speak, friend, and enter?_ asked Merry.
"That is plain enough," said Gimli. "If you are a friend, speak the
password, and the doors will open, and you can enter."
"Yes," said Gandalf, "these doors are probably governed by words ..."

in _Cryptography_ ;-)

(Just yell if "I really want to get out of this discussion" still applies)

If we expand "small secrets" so that our secrets are evaluated in terms of
the cost to us of their being compromised - big secrets, high cost - then
doesn't it make sense to spend only as much on secrecy as we think our
secret is worth?

Since "absolute" security is absolutely unattainable aren't we actually
obliged to do this (unless we're in it for amusement sake only)?

Isn't "good enough" good enough?  PGP seems good enough to me, but, then,
I've only got small secrets.  And a public key posted here is just a 
supply of envelopes.

   This is a neat idea. If the calculator breaks, the spy goes to the
   nearest office supply store and buys another. I haven't read about
   anything like this in the literature. It wasn't possible much more
   than 20 years ago, since computers (calculators) weren't consumer
   items.

He doesn't have to wait for it to break.  He enters the enemy country
without carrying the calculator through customs, and buys one after
he gets there.  If he thinks he might get searched soon, he throws
the calculator away and buys another one when he has some traffic
to encrypt.

   How do you know TI or HP or Casio haven't already done it?  :-)

How do *you* know that I don't know if they've done it?  :-)

   Thanks for contributing some new material to this group, rather
   than rehashing the current discussions about what precautions
   rabidly paranoid people should take to prevent Big Brother from
   spoofing ALL their communication with everyone on every possible
   subject in real time.

But spies might have to worry about Big B. reprogramming the calculators
in the local office supply store... :-)

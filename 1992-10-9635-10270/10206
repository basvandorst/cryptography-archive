On a side note, a good example of the risks here is in the implementation of
the RICO statutes.  Since the police/DEA/whoever seem unable to stem the
smuggling of drugs into the US in any other way, we now have the widespread
practice of police/DEA in certain airports stopping and searching people just
because they happen to fit a certain "profile" and confiscating any "excessive"
amount of cash for which they can't account.  You have to prove (somehow) that
it is your money.  Can you say Napoleonic Code?  Sure you can.  The really
scary thing is that this kind of outrage seems to get very little media play.
While not directly related to public-key cryptography, the issues involved are
very alike.  On philosophical grounds, I object to not being able to communicate
with someone else unless I get permission first.

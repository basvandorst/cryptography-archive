  I've recently started using a NeXT machine at work (love it!), and I came
across an application called ForYourEyesOnly that purports to be a public
key cryptography system.  It looks, well, less than robust.
  The encryption algorithm is not explained (the help file says it's being
kept secret by design), but it is not RSA.  A dialog box seems to let you
choose the public and secret keys independently.  No prime generation or
anything.  Oh, I forgot, the help file does say that factoring is not used
in this system.
  Has anyone had a look inside this thing?  How strong is it?

  Thanks,
  Joe

P.S. Yeah, I was way off on that quantum cryptography post a while back.  
Photons can't be cloned.  The EPR effect is for particle pairs whose
properties are more strongly linked (by conservation laws, for example).

P.P.S. This is my third attempt at posting this.  Sorry about any wasted
bandwidth...

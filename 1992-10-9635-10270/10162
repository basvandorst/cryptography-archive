Which is of course nonsense and therefore dangerous.

There are plenty of example where everyone gives up a little liberty in
order to obtain more safety. E.g in traffic:

Traffic lights, speed limits, driving to the right (or left in appropriate
countries).

I would say that you can only get safety by sacrificing some liberty.

The real question is "How much liberty do we want to sacrifice for how much
safety?" This is often a political question, at least when it regards
things that transcend the private life.

There are no simple answers to the above question, except maybe that
sacrificing absolutely no liberty, or sacrificing all liberty are not the
solution.

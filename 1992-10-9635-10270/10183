First Amendment should protect confidential information exchange. Here
are a few short excerpts from the American Library Association's
"Statement Concerning Confidentiality of Personally Identifiable
Information About Library Users":


'The First Amendment's guarantee of freedom of speech and of the press
requires that the corresponding rights to hear what is spoken and read
what is written be preserved, free from fear of government intrusion,
intimidation or reprisal.  Confidentiality is essential to protect the
exercise of these rights from governmental invasions of privacy.
...
The American Library Association has received several reports of
visits by agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation to libraries,
where agents allegedly have asked for personally identifiable
information about library patrons.  These visits, whether within the
so-called "Library Awareness Program" or not, reflect an insensitivity
to the role confidentiality plays in the preservation of First
Amendment rights, rights which extend also to foreign nationals while
in the United States.  The Bureau's interest in library records
reflects a dangerous and fallacious equation of what a person reads
with what that person believes or how that person is likely to behave.
This presumption is a threat to the freedom to read.  It is also a
threat to a crucial aspect of First Amendment rights: that freedom of
speech and of the press include the freedom to hold, disseminate and
receive unpopular, minority, "extreme" or even "dangerous" ideas.'

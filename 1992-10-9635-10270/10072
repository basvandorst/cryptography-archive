Yes!  When a person's property is being searched, the police must present
the search warrant *to that person*, up front.  Black Bag jobs are strictly
illegal.

Let's modify the Denning proposal to have each key be held as a shared
secret (Adi Shamir's 1979 algorithm), with the ACLU and Common Cause in the
list of organizations who have to agree to use the key -- and a computer
system which decrypts session keys from the shared secret inputs, never
releasing the private key -- and immediate notification of the key owner
every time this occurs.


Have the key release threshold require 100% agreement among:

	1.	senate majority leader
	2.	senate minority leader
	3.	house majority leader
	4.	house minority leader
	5.	US Supreme Court
	6.	Department of Justice
	7.	ACLU
	8.	Common Cause
	9.	The Washington Post
	10.	The New York Times

in response to a court order.  Require a court order as usual to capture
the encrypted traffic and let the current machinery operate as it is but if
the traffic is discovered to be encrypted, notify the key owner first and
get all 10 parties to agree that the court order is valid.

Maybe then we have a system which protects our rights.

Of course, the real answer is to outlaw wiretapping.

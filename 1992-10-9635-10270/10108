	Which is exactly why the people should have it; to keep the
government honest. That is what the Second Amendment was all about. For
the same reasons that the founding fathers wanted us to have firearms and
munitions, they would also have wanted us to have secure cryptosystems.

	OK, so it is a bit of a stretch. But I couldn't help but see the same
arguments here on this thread. Requiring honest citizens to register keys.
Criminals who will merely use unregistered keys for their work. "If crypto-
graphy is outlawed, then only criminals will have cryptography."

	Sorry, I don't want/intend to take this off on a tangent; just point
out the similarities in argument and governmental intent.

	And yes I do see a need to mount a concerted effort to prevent our
beloved paternalistic government from legislating our privacy away. At this
juncture, our rights are under attack like no other time in history.

	 So -- the question now is -- what are we going to do about it?


	P.S. I am the NRA.

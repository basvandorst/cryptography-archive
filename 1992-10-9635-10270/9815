I know that this is probably the wrong group to ask, but
nevertheless, here it goes.

From the RSA FAQ, page 4, answer to question 1.5:

"The authors of patent 4,218,582 claim that it applies to all uses of
public-key cryptography. It has been patented throughout the world."

The claims in patent 4,218,582 cover any use of public key
cryptosystems - regardless of the method used. Seems that the whole
idea is patented. (Please do not start a flame war about how stupid a
patent law that permits an algorithm to be patented is.)

What bothers me are the words "throughout the world". Till now, I
thought that it only applies in the USA. So I asked the following
question to the editor of the RSA FAQ:

Well, so I am asking those of you who are "in Europe": do you have any
information about the above? Could you tell me in which countries
exactly public-key cryptography is patented and which are the patent
numbers? Thanks in advance.

This argument shows that the MINIMUM value of n is different for each plaintext
character.  However, the number of plaintext characters is finite (even in
DEX it is 2^64, which is finite) and the least common multiple of the various
n's has the property that repeating the substitution that many times will
transform each plaintext character into itself.  Far from disproving the
original assertion, you have proved it!

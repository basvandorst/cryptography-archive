This is a contradiction in terms.

If all you keep is 32 bits, then it's too easy to find a collision for any
given checksum (ie., by brute force search).  Therefore, it's not
cryptographically strong.

To make it strong, you have to make sure that the hash algorithm which
produces those 32 bits takes many years to run on today's fastest
computer to compute a single value -- but then, you probably wouldn't
want to use it.  :-)

However, given simple secret key systems (forget public key), I can store
data in such a way that it can not be reached by the Government, encrypted
using only a memorized pass phrase.  The only way to get the pass phrase
out of me would be to force me to speak against my will.  That sounds like
it fits your description.


If I happened to share that pass phrase with a friend and happened to share
some of that encrypted data with that friend, he is free to keep it on his
system under the same conditions and protections.


Of course, if we had been engaged in something illegal, the prosecutor is
free to ask one of us what the other said -- and if we were to lie on the
stand, we'd be guilty of perjury.  *That* is the remedy provided to the
Government.

This does not give the Government the right to attempt to force a secret
out of my mind -- or out of my hard disk, if I have used it for overflow
storage for my mind, thanks to this technology called cryptography.

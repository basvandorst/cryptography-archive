   As has been pointed out here, Prof. Denning's proposal has
   some minor flaws: malefactors might encrypt their nefarious
   missives with their own unauthorized crypto systems before
   encrypting them with the approved registered keys.

   To address this issue I propose a slight modification of
   Prof. Denning's scheme.  Since the Trustworthy Independent
   Agency (TIA) will have all the necessary keys, it might as
   well perform the actual encryption as an additional service
   at little extra cost. [...]
Hm. Time for open codes (bury the real plaintext inside one of
a large stock of innocuous-looking letters), at least for bursty
traffic ... besides, the TIA would have to be able to recognize
file attachments (graphics, sound files, programs, ...) or did
you think ASCII was forever?

And then there are "free" media like "pirate" radio -- voice
scramblers could get stronger -- and so on -- I think the cat is out
of the bag right now.

Thanks to several individuals on the net 
for responding to my request for PGP2.0.         
 
As a way of saying "thanks," I will send
a copy of this MS-DOS 3.5" DD disk to                                 
you with the complete source and object                                     
in return for:                                                          
 
(1) A SASE with two ounces postage or two IRC's;        
and a blank 3.5" DD disk, OR
                                 
(2) a donation of US$3 -- $5 if you also want
a disk containing sources to DES, Lucifer, SHA,
and other algorithms.                              

Right now I cannot ship outside North America, but
I will be able to when I finish my "code-to-documentation"
algorithm that dithers source code into documentation
whose expression is protected under the first
admendment of the U.S. Constitution.

You may want to take advantage of this mode of
distribution if it is difficult or inconvenient to
download, FTP, or be e-mail served this material,
or if you want a "second copy" to serve as a
cross-check on your primary distribution method.

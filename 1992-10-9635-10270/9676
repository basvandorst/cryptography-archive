I agree that it's possible to isolate a single machine and spoof it --
although even that smacks of Mission Impossible -- but that's not what was
being claimed in the postings which bothered me.  It was claimed that a
human who is trying to disseminate his own public key can be totally
isolated, even if he's aware of that possible attack so that it doesn't pay
for him to try to send out a key.  It is against that kind of nonsense that
I was arguing.

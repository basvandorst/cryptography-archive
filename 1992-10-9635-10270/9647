This is the problem with your idea.  In "The Codebreakers" this method is 
known as a "one-time pad" which are unbreakable.  Their problem is the logistics
required to properly use the system.  Key distribution is another problem.  In
your idea there would have to be a face to face meeting to exchange CDs. What
happens if you mail the CD out?  It could be copied or lost or damaged, etc.

All in all, your idea seems to be a sound one but still suffers from a 
logistical standpoint.

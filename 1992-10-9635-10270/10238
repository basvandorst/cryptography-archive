OK, I admit it was a bit of an unbased rambling soapbox talk and
one-sided (and said as much in my posting), but your objection doesn't
appear to be any better.

Hmm, webster will have use again - it seems everytime someone flames
me I learn new words.  Oops, didn't find "aggrandizing" or "aggrand".

Left-wing?  Excuse me, but what in the world has this to do with
"left-wing"?

While representative democracy is somewhat usable and has some
advantages over some other systems, I hardly would take it as an
example of the achivements or superiority of "western culture".  Talk
about technology, perhaps, or alienation from church-based religions
and then I'll admit there are some good points.  Or the U.S.
Constitution, which if I am not incorrect is to a great deal based on
the French revolution or something like that (yes, I said it was
unbased, I mostly sleeped through my history classes).  Or the
"welfare state" idea, social security system (which has many problems
on the civil liberties side, though).

By the way, who is this William J. Bennett who has such great
authority in your eyes?

(oops, I will probably be roasted for this post.  Followups directed

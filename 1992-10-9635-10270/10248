In addition to the civil liberty issues with encryption, one should
also consider the international competitive issue.

The October 26, 1992 Issue of Computerworld has an article titled
"I SPY" (P.129). The gist of the article is that foreign govts. are
using spy technology to obtain trade secrets from U.S. companies. 
The trade secrets are then passed on to state owned (or at least
state controlled) companies for their competitive advantage. 

The question is: If encryption is limited by our government, how
Can we expect to protect ourselves from other governments' spying?
One of the worst offenders is appearently the U.K. (One of our
staunchest cold world allies). The same argument can be made for
the FBI's proposed back door into comm equip.

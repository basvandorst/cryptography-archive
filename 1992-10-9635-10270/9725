There are two issues here: 1) The academic consideration of RNGs with
"truely" random distributions and 2) The consideration of being able to
predict the random number series.

All of the academic consideration of RNGs I have seen focus on 1). 2) is
necessary for using them in an encryption system. I have made my RNGs
pretty unpredictable by running 32 different Additive Congruential Method
RNGs, and only selecting one bit of each for each 32-bit number. I do so
by randomly (another RNG) selecting the particular bit from each. Of course,
this is computationally extremely expensive.

I believe that the OTP using itis pretty safe. However, safety can be improved
by compressing the oriignal file and then distributing it randomly through
a random number file.

The compression removes redundancy in the signal. The distributing it randomly
through a random number file hides the signal in noise, similar to spread
spectrum transmission.

However, none of this works if the opposition can predict the random number
series.

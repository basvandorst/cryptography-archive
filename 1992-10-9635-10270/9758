I'd say this is a contradiction in terms.  Four billion is not a very large
number.  A low-end workstation executes this many instructions in minutes.  A
given message could probably be spoofed with a few weeks of CPU time.  Of
course if you send out many messages, it's that much easier for your opponent
to find a match.  I think even 64 bits isn't all that safe.  There's a reason
why good hash algorithms put out 128 bits or more.

   Any encryption scheme that has a fixed block length *must* do this. Think
   of a series of encryptions:
	   x_1 -> x_2 -> x_3 -> ... -> x_k -> ... -> x_n -> ...
   If 'n' is greater than the possible number of messages that can be encoded
   in the fixed length block, there must be some blocks in the chain that
   are the same (pigeonhole principle). Let x_k and x_n be the same blocks.
   Then by encrypting x_k (n-k)-times yields x_k.

   (n-k) might be quite large, though. ;-)

For DES, 2^64 = 1.8e19. Fits my def'n of large, all right!

   ps. I'm not sure, but it would seem that this applies to every
       block x_n.....?

Good point, I'm sure that is part of the rationale for cipher block
chaining. Your argument holds for (still using DES terms) all blocks
in ECB mode, or for any plaintext less than or equal to the blocksize
in any mode.

Of course, I don't see how this provides much of an angle for the
cryptanalyst, since exploiting it would seem to require the key!

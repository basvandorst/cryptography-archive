One thing they seem to do well is cover up their misdeeds, judging from
the widespread ignorance of COINTELPRO-type abuses during the 80s.
Anyone looking for a good scare should read the article:
"COINTELPRO in the '80s: The 'New' FBI" which I just posted to
misc.activism.progressive.  Also see the 8-part series "War at Home" which
was posted to m.a.p. this month.

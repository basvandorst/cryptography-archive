Considera linear congruential random number generator.  Suppose
its output is rounded or truncated and the result used as a
pseudo-one-time-pad.  Since this system is easy to think of and
implement, and isn't used instead of things like DES, we may
presume that it is weak.
 
It would be nice to know exactly why.  For example, say the
random numbers are x[i], where x[i+1]=(a*x[i]+b) mod m.  Suppose
that the sequence y[i], where y[i]=x[i] div d, is used as the
key.  If we are making a known plaintext attack, we will have
determined some of the y[i] from the ciphertext together with
the known plaintext.  It would be interesting to know how to
find a, b, x[i], m, and d from the y[i].
 
Perhaps the easiest interesting case is to assume that we already
know a, b, m, d, y[0], and y[1], and that b=0, m is a large power
of 2 (maybe m=2^1024), d is a smaller power of 2 with d*d<m (maybe
d=2^256), and a is not close to 0 or m.
 
With the suggested values, we know the most significant 768 bits of
x[0] and x[1].  How do we get the other 256 bits?  It seems that
an attack fast enough to be interesting would require that the
computer time used be polynomial in the number of bits in m.
 
I would be interested in seeing a program, an algorithm outline,
or a reference.  Either the general case or my chosen easier case
would be very interesting.  If these questions can't be freely
answered due to the ITAR or for other security reasons a statement
to that effect might also be interesting, depending on the details
and author of the statement.
 
Thanks

I am wondering if there is an archival site for this group. If anyone is
maintaining one and wouldn't mind permitting public consumption, please
speak up. Also, I think including that information in the FAQ being
worked on would be very useful.

[I've already looked in news.answers, comp.archives, checked via archie
and a WAIS server I found through archie for this information.]

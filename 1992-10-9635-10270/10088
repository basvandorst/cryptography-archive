I don't think that Ben Franklin saw them as opposites, either.  He was
just making the point that if you have a choice between being free or
being safe, choose free.  

I think you'd find serious disagreement as to whether the ability to
kill or steal is actually a liberty.  (I could also say "The liberty
to be afraid of everything and live in complete fear for my life,"
but that doesn't mean "to be afraid of ..." is actually a liberty,
any more than saying "My dog, the cat" actually makes my cat a dog.)

Oh yeah.  The usual disclaimers apply here.

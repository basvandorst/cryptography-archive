A number of people have asked me the same questions about the book, so I
figured that one answer will suffice for everyone.

1)  Hopefully, the book will be published by next August, in time for Crypto
93.

2)  There will be a source code disk that goes along with the book.  No, it
will not be sold with the book.  (Keep in mind that the author has little
say in any of these decisions--it's the publisher's call.)  I will, myself,
sell it seperately.  I don't know for how much; enough to cover expenses.
Unfortunately, I cannot send it to addresses outside the country.  I won't be
able to put the code on an ftp site for the same reason.  (I don't like this
solution either, but it wasn't my choice.)

3)  Right now the plan is for the book to come out in both a hardcover and
a paperback edition.  Who knows what will happen when the time comes.

Otherwise, I am still looking for pieces of code to include.

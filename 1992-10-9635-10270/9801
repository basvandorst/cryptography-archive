	Yeah, incredible isn't it! It seems most americans don't care 
	how daffy (or evil!) their government is.  We've got an enormous 
	bureauracy devoted to fighting an "evil empire" which is now defunct, 
	we've got fundamentalist nut cases determining what goes into high 
	school biology texts and we have a War on Some Drugs that is quickly 
	eroding	what is left of the Bill of Rights.  We've also got a bunch of 
	cold war left overs in the NSA trying to protect us from the
	"evil empire" and in the process harming the US telecommunications
	industry.  It's a sad horrible joke but you get blank looks from 
	the man in the street when you mention it.  Perhaps now that the
	economy has hit the skids and we are on the edge of another great
	depression people will start to look at who our real enemies are
	and see that they aren't foreign after all. . .

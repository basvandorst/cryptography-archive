Dear Netters :

	I am curious if there is any information about how to apply
	Diophantine approximation to break a knapsack cipher.  I have
	already found out to use Lenstra algorithm to find out the
	possible intervals that the trapdoor pairs exist.  However, the
	range of possible trapdoor pair is so large ( for a n-bit
	knapsack cipher, the range is about 2**2n to 2**(2n+1)), so an
	exhausted search is not practical.  I hope that I can get some
	information about what paper or book should I look into to apply
	Diophantine algorithm on finding knapsack pair.

	Any information will be appreciated heartily  !!

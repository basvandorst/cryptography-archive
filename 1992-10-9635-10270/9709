A number of people have replied to my question about the PEM protocol,
pointing out that even if the private key involved in one message
exchange were to be discovered, this would only have the effect of a
"known plaintext attack" on the RSA encryption used to exchange the
keys.  In other words, the sender's private RSA would remain secure.

Thanks for the response.

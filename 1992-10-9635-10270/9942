crtpt(1) is but crypt(3) is used by login, passwd, etc- they can't smip
it out (??). Anyway , look in Muffat's Crack. It has the source code for
fcrypt a direct replacement for crypt. ( Use archie to find sources for
Crack- I don't have them off hand)
(and Muffat is in England, so you needn't worry about the problems of
export restrictions)`

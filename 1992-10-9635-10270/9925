``Certify the integrity of a document''?

Words like ``integrity'' and ``trust'' are meaningless as absolute
terms. Unless you're saying *what* you trust to be true, you can't say
whether your trust has been broken. Normally you want to trust Joe's
signature to convey the information ``Joe wrote this document.'' If
there isn't any Joe---the document is anonymous---then there isn't any
question of trust.

If I can listen to what you say then I can say it myself. How can you
possibly expect otherwise?

I've got two questions about Denning's proposal that may be added
to the somewhat heated debate:

a) How will the system work on international communications?
   (Will I have to register my key with the US govt. to be able
   to use encrypted communications?)

b) Will steganography be illegal as well? How should the law
   enforcement agencies _prove_ that steganography was used?

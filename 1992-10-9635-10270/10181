Just in case people are wondering about a particular example of this
kind of thing already on the books, consider that people have died
because telephone companies keep records of long distance calls.

I have been told, in fact, that this is the major reason a number of
european phone systems don't do itemized phone bills -- people considered
the hassle of not being able to get misbillings corrected a reasonable
trade for life and liberty. (Which is pretty good, considering that in
the U.S. law enforcement doesn't even need a warrant to place a pen
register on your phone and records every number you dial -- including
voicemail passwords and such)

 One proposal to archive public-key secret parts was made recently
 by no less a luminary than Ron Rivest, writing in the July 1992
 Communications of the ACM (p. 46):

    "I suspect that a solution based on 'escrowed secret keys'
    might be workable, wherein each user is legally required to
    deposit his or her secret key with a trusted third party,
    such as the user's bank.  Cryptographic hardware and software
    would only operate with public keys that were certified to
    having their corresponding secret keys appropriately
    escrowed.  A federal agency could then obtain the secret
    key, or its use, with an appropriate warrant."


 The problem I have with "warrants" is that it often seems that
 relatively little evidence is required to obtain one.  In many
 cases, law enforcement agencies can find judges who generally
 approve a particular sort of warrant.  Thus, warrants may not
 give the protection that one might think.  And if evidence can
 be used even when obtained under an illegal warrant, there is
 precious little protection at all.

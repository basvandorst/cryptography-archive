        I have come across an implementation of RSA distributed by a
        company in Wales, UK, which claims to perform RSA encryption
        on the entire file, rather than just on a session key for a
        conventional algorithm.  The program may be common knowledge,
        but it is the first time I have come across it.  It is called
        MCRYPT, and is distributed by a company called Digital
        Crypto as shareware.

        What puzzles me is that encryption is very fast - less than 2
        minutes for a 40k text file using a 250 digit key - but
        decryption is _glacial_ - over 3 hours for the same file on
        the same PC.

        If anyone is interested in looking at this, you may find it
        on a BBS near you - if not drop me a note and I'll email it
        to you.  I believe I can email it to addresses in the States,
        but once there, it may not be exported again...

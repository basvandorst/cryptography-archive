There is an amiga binary already available. You can get it on
amiga.physik.unizh.ch  /amiga/util/crypt/PGP20amiga.lha
I suggest you use this one, cause the original pgp package
misses some vital amiga files (mostly assembler) 
I did include them with this binary and they will be added to
the next pgp release.
If anyone makes any patches for amiga, id also like to have them,
so we can also put them into the released versions.

Lemme know what you need. Im not really into atari or anything, but
there shouldnt be too much changes between amiga<->atari.
Most of the 68000 routines I have probably work on atari
with little change.

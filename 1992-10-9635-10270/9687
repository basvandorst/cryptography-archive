Well, looking at the Maple situation; it's got 10000 digits of Pi as a
"built-in" thing.  People tend to check out what Pi looks like as one
of their first bits of "playing" with it, so the SCG put 10K digits
in.

I would be totally unsurprised to hear that Wolfram did the same with
Mathematica.

What this means is that there's a table of 10000 digits (which can
probably get BCD packed into about 5K as a "no-brainer" optimization).
I once get Maple going to compute digit 10001.  I didn't wait for it
to find it; it probably would take a LONG time.  Hours?  Days?  Weeks?
I don't know which.

It's PROBABLY going to be pretty random; I think there have been a
number of theses in statistics/number theory on the arrangement of
digits in Pi.

Unfortunately, any irrational number whose properties are "ugly"
enough for encryption purposes is probably gonna be a pain to compute
to any significant number of decimal places.

Remember as well that the term "irrational" applies to numbers whose
digits DO have lots of patterns; the only requirement is that the
period be non-constant.

I don't think it's stupid, it's just not likely to be {\bf practical}.
This is true of MANY things in math...  

Of late, I've been doing stuff on solving minimum cost network
problems.  There's some recent "cute" algorithms that are
theoretically wonderful.  Unfortunately, the "classic" Simplex method
will beat 'em into the ground for any problems that are not absolutely
ENORMOUS (and that current hardware probably couldn't solve EITHER
way).

Enough work, and perhaps one of the algorithms may be made practical.
And in working on improvements, some other idea may come out.  Working
with irrational number patterns probably works this way too.

I was very surprised to read the proposal by Dorothy Denning.  From
previous work and writings I had seen by her I had gotten to respect
her writing style and content and her interest and in the electronic
communications culture.  It was a shock to read her present such
oppressive, anti-freedom ideas.

I hope Dorothy can be persuaded to change her mind and oppose such
proposals.

Before anyone asks what it's got to do with me, living in Finland, let
me say that I have a big respect for the ideas of personal freedom
presented in the U.S. Constitution - also, on a more selfish
viewpoint, USA is a big political, military and economic power and
what happens in USA will inevitably influence small countries such as
Finland.  Thus I react with fear and disappointment to see the ideas
USA was founded on to get destroyed, doubly so when it seems it happens
because of the effort of well-meaning and intelligent people.

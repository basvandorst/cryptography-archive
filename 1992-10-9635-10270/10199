We finally have a benefit to BOTH the government and the citizen from
cryptography.


If encryption were universal and keys were kept secret, in the hands of
the owner only, the government could still perform a wiretap.  Once in
posession of an encrypted conversation, the Gov't can now prove if
a citizen's claimed plaintext is truthful -- by applying the citizen's
session key.

The citizen keeps his privacy.

The Gov't gains an ability to prove perjury or the lack of it.

Sounds good to me.

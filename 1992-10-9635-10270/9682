This is a neat idea. If the calculator breaks, the spy goes to the nearest
office supply store and buys another. I haven't read about anything like this
in the literature. It wasn't possible much more than 20 years ago, since
computers (calculators) weren't consumer items.

How do you know TI or HP or Casio haven't already done it?  :-)

Thanks for contributing some new material to this group, rather than rehashing
the current discussions about what precautions rabidly paranoid people should
take to prevent Big Brother from spoofing ALL their communication with everyone
on every possible subject in real time.

Hi. I was able to compile PGP under XENIX here, but ONLY using the 8086.asm
module. The 80386.S module was written for gcc which I don't have, and Micro-
soft C 5.0 just sat there doing nothing, chugging away at it.

So I had to 'make x286' for PGP instead of using the 32 bit stuff and the 80386
assembly module. So PGP is very slow.

Does anyone have a working version of the file 80386.[Ss] in the source
distribution that works on non-gcc cc?? I would grately appreciate any help.

If you can help, send to: norstar@tnl.com

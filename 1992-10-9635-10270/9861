>(n-k) might be quite large, though. ;-)

However there is nothing in your argument to say that (k,n) are not
dependent on the original block being encrypted.

for "circular", we want something more like:

there exists n such that

 n
E (x) = x   for all blocks x  

where E is the encryption function in question.

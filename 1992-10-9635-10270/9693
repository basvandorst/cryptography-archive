It seems that I didn't express my question well enough. By
"cryptographically strong" I meant that there is no other way to forge
it than brute force.

Anyway, several people replied by privete e-mail. Their opinions can
be grouped into two groups:

1) That any consecutive 32 bits of the result are equally good.

2) That I should use a 32-bit hash function of the result - like a
CRC-32, or divide the result into 32-bit chunks and XOR them together,
and so on.

Interestingly, everybody who supported opinion 2) mentioned in their
message "I am not a crypto expert". :-)

Well, I guess that I'll use the 32 least significant bits of MD4, MD5,
or SHA.

For those of you that are curious, I don't need this checksum for
strong authentication purposes. I am writing a utility that creates
"maps" of the constant areas of the different computer viruses and
keeps the checksums of these areas. The checksums are further used for
exact virus identification. I just wanted to make difficult enough for
the virus writers to forge them, i.e. to create a virus which has the
same map with the same checksums of the constant areas, but the virus
is different. 32 bits are strong enough for my purpose.

Again, thanks to everybody who responded.

Regards,
Vesselin

These two facts seem to be correlated.  If you look at the listings
for channel 68 in Boston, for example, you'll find that every listing,
even for prime time one-hour or half-hour programs, has more than
six digits.

So, roughly, the added two digits in the longer codes must encode
the extra channel numbers as well as the number of five-minute
increments to add/subtract from the start time and duration.

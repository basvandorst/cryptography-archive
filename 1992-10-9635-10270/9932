Yes indeed. And thanks to SCMS (the Serial Copy Management System, the
digital "copy protection" mechanism in DAT) no one would think it
unusual when a DAT copy of a given CD doesn't exactly match it,
bit-for-bit.  The cascaded D/A A/D coding, not to mention the
different sampling rates (44.1 Khz for CD, 48 Khz for DAT from an
analog input) would all create excellent opportunities to hide one
time pads.

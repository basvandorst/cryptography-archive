A number of European countries require some form of
key registration before cryptography can be used in
telecommunications.  I believe that both France and
Germany have laws of this kind.

I personally am uncomfortable with crypto key
registration, but there certainly is precedent for it
in the laws of some "Western democracies".  

Some months ago, someone on sci.crypt mentioned that
Thomas Jefferson had written something on cryptography
and individual freedoms.  Does anyone have a pointer
to the actual quotation?  (Remember that among his
many other talents, Jefferson was a very good cryptographer
for his day, and he designed a crypto system that was
used by the US Army all the way up to the beginning of
this century.)

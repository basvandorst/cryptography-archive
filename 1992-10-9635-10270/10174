You are summing the improvement in privacy resulting from widespread
crypto (which will happen without Denning's proposal) with the
destruction of liberty which the proposal represents, and deciding
that on the whole, we come out ahead.  This logic is bogus.  The
appropriate states to compare are "five years hence; secure
communications" with "five years hence; the Feds have our keys."

The Mafia does not follow the law.  It will not lay its
communications out for the government to peruse.  The result of the
proposal would be to tack on a few years for "unauthorized privacy"
to whatever sentence you could have gotten on Mafiosi anyway.

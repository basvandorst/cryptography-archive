Indeed. I've been making this point regarding anti-piracy devices for
some time. Even if Videocipher, for example, had not been broken there
would have been no way to prevent someone from taping the output of a
legitimate decoder and selling it or giving it away. The same is
undoubtedly true for software packages, at least those running on
standard general purpose machines. If you can't trust the authorized
user, then all bets are off.

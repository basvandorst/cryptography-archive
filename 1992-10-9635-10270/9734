Re: engineering a bacterium to search for DES keys.

Basically the same idea (with a different implementation) is found in
a recent CACM article about a technique called the Chinese Lottery.

The implementation there is to manufacture a device which randomly
tries DES keys on a stored plaintext/ciphertext pair and then
manufacture these into television sets, achieving parallelism on the
order of millions.  When the internal chip finds a match, it tells you
you've won the lottery!  Call 1-800-GET-CASH with the following number
[...] to collect your $1000 prize.

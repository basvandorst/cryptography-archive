Hi Michel...

I've got an Atari STE and had the same question,  but now I  have 
PGP 2.0 as source. If you have a C-Compiler and you are familliar 
with the C-Language you could compile it on your Amiga.

If you don't find anyone in your reach who can get you a copy  of 
the  sources of PGP,  please email me and I will send it to  you. 
PGP is packed with ZIP,  but you need a quite new version of  it. 
If you like I can pack it with LHarc (lh1 or lh5), ARJ or ZOO.
LHarc is fully compatible to the Amiga-version (I've tested often 
enough with soundmodule-files).

By  the way.  Is anyone out there who can help me?  I've got  the 
Problem than I'm NOT familliar with the C-Language and so I'm not 
able to compile PGP.


so long...

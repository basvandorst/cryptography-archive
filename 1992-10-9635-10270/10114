In response to some requests, I've made a copy of the U.S. Constitution
available for ftp on research.att.com.  It's in dist/smb/us-constitution;
I don't think you need an export license...  (N.B.  This was a copy that
was posted to the net a few years ago by Mike Ward, back when the newsgroup
space and the mail address space were flat...)

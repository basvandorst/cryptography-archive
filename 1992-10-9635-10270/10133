I took this description from an ad for a new DES chip from VLSI Technology Inc.

The 8-bit VM009 data encryption processor provides a complete cryptographic
system on a chip.  Like the earlier VM007, the VM009 contains a hardware
implementation of the US Department of Commerce's Data Encryption Standard
(DES).  The VM009 can encrypt or decrypt data at > 100 Mbps using 64-bit
data words on an 8-bit bus architecture.  The IC's three separate text
ports simultaneously transfer data in and out of the device.
The chip supports select DES modes of operation, flexible data interfaces, and
three key registers.  Available in 40-lead plastic DIPs and 44-lead PLCCs for
use over the commercial-temperature ranges. VM009, $30 (1000); VM007,
$119 (5000) For info call VLSI Technology at (602) 752-6300.

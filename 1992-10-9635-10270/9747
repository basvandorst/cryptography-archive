Why go to all the trouble.  If you really want to make it complex encrypt a  
short message into decimal characters and use the resulting number as a measure  
for a piece of non-heat expansive material.  Put this material into a common  
item and ship.  The receiver removes the material and measures it with an  
electron microscope, figures out the measure and decodes the message.  if there  
are any errors in his measure it would only effect the last few characters of  
the code.  But again this is pointless.  Why do you need to transmit one  
message thousands of times?

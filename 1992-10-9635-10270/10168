	No, never. Not without a carefully considered court order in each
and every case, and the keys for any private business of mine should stay
mine without that court order. The government has no business even being
ABLE to listen to me without my knowledge and consent.
	It's really annoying to think that the government wants to have
access to private material without the owner's consent. They could at
least be honest about being nosy and use the super-spy gadgetry they
have to obtain the info. If they can't, tough.

	Over the past several years, I've been considering methods whereby
the "average man" could be protected from this nosiness. I've figured out
one that, in principle, could work. However, it would also be technically
illegal. The lawsuit would be interesting, though, since the essential
issue would be "does the government's right to know exceed the individual's
right to privacy, as a rule?".
	If the answer was YES, then we're in serious trouble.

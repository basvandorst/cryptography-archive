For this system to work, great effort would have to be devoted to insuring
that people only used approved crypto programs and registered keys. It also
does nothing to prevent people from encrypting with an un-approved program
and/or un-registered key and then encrypting the result with the approved program
and registered key. If the system works as described, detecting an "illegal"
use of encryption requires the registered keys in usable form be available
to those scanning the traffic looking for "illegal" messages.

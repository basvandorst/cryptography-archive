Question:

Let's say Alice and Bob are engaged in a criminal conspiracy.
They have an encryption system which uses RSA for key exchange, and DES
for encipherment.

Alice sends Bob an encrypted message, which is intercepted.  The plain
text of the same message also becomes available, and through some
cryptanalytic technique the secret DES key used for that encryption is
found.

The question is, to what extent does the discovery of the secret key
used in that one exchange compromise the system being used?  Can one
infer information about Alice's secret RSA key?

It means nothing.

The only reason we (factoring researchers) can do integers of this size
is that they have a very special form that allows the number to be
written as a polynomial with VERY (in this case single digit) coefficients.

i.e. let N = 2^523 - 1. Then 4N = 2^525 - 4. Let M = 2^(525/5) = 2^105.

Then 4N = M^5 - 4.   It is only because this polynomial in M has small
coefficients that the number can be factored.

If you should try to represent an arbitrary number of this size as a
5th degree (not necessarily monic) polynomial, the coefficients will
generally be 'about' 24 or 25 digits. A big difference.

Nevertheless, it was a nice piece of work by Arjen and Dan.

Given the tenor of your post, you're hardly in a position to accuse anyone
of pontification.

Kind of depends on how you interpret the word "search" in this context.
And if there weren't some doubt about this, I wonder why judges would have
bothered to infer something which you seem to clearly think doesn't exist.

Right.  And if I'm charged with committing some crime or other, they can
force me to divulge my private key.  What's that you say?  What if I give
them the wrong one?  How's that any different from my lying about the talk
I had with my friend?  Actually, it's easier, since a bogus key should produce
garbage, which would be prima facie evidence of non-cooperation; whereas an
account of a conversation is much harder to disprove (unless there were other
witnesses to it).

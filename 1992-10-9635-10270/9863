Once more with feeling... You Can't Clone Quantum States.  If you
could, then you could copy a particle, measure its wave function in
one axis, the other particle in the other axis, and violate the
uncertainty principle.  You can't.

Lasers and laser-like amplifiers DO maintain polarization for incoming
beams with large numbers of photons.  They do not for incoming single
photons.  All of the photons coming out of the amplifier will be in
the same state (nearly), but this state is NOT RELIABLY IDENTICAL to the
incoming (single) photon state.

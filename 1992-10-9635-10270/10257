        Sometimes it truly is a joy to be living north of the 49th. On
        a day when many of us are celebrating the recent saving of our
        Charter of Rights and Freedoms from being watered down by a
        venal bunch of self-interested politicians, I would like to
        ask two questions:

     1. Given that the NSA has classified secret codes as armament,
        doesn't your Second Amendment right to bear arms therefore
        also guarantee your right to use secret codes?

     2. This "trusted third party", the Justice Department -- aren't
        these the people tromping all over everybody's rights and
        resisting political accountability in the Inslaw affair?

        Just thought I'd ask.

Perhaps, but I wouldn't bet on it, unless I got some proof.

I have some code that does exactly that (uses the Miller test). The 
reason I became worried was that Kenneth Rosen incorrectly states
in his book that "If n is composite the probability that n passes
all k tests is less than (1/4)^k." This is incorrect as was pointed out.

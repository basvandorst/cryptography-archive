Well, this `liberty' argument may be a dead end. Who on earth promised
anyone to have the "liberty to live without complete fear". An opposing
view would be to talk about the `restricted regime of the faint-hearted'.

An important mechanism to guard our right to private property is the legal
system. We gain some liberty, and the legal system makes it possible to
right wrong. One weakness is that anyone can loose their health, family and
fortune waiting for justice.

You used the phrase "reasonable expectation of safety" in your first
example. I agree, but remember that we reason differently.

That's for sure.

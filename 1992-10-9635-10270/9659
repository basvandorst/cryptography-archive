Obviously, if you know the key used, then DES is reversible - how else, can
the plaintext be retrieved.  However, if you mean is it possible to reverse 
the process to produce the plaintext & key from the ciphertext, then the answer
is NO.

Why not?  Each of the subkeys is used in an XOR operation, you can't reverse
this one to one.  A XOR B = C, if you know C you can't be sure what A and B are.

OK?

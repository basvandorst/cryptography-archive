A) It shows that the system is pretty seriously compromised at the DES
level.  It doesn't matter how good the key exchange system is, if
someone can break the code WITHOUT a key.

B) Alice's secret RSA key isn't particularly compromised; the "evil
decoders" haven't found out any information that they wouldn't have
been able to figure out given (1) The DES key and (2) Alice's public key.

If they COULD, then it means that Bob could, from the information HE was
intended to receive, infer information about Alice's secret RSA key.  If
THAT is the case, then RSA is very seriously flawed for ANY encryption
purpose.  It ain't a good public key system no more...

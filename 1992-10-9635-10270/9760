Bob, 
Your choice of words in this article runs a serious chance of confusing 
the issue.

What you call a "private key" above should be called a "single message key"
to avoid any chance of someone else confusing it with the "private key"
part of a public key encryption system, what you call "private RSA" above.

A large part of PGP's strength is due to the fact that very limited amounts of
information are ever directly protected by a single key, i.e., only one
message is ever protected by the "single message key" and only the (very small
amount of information of the) "single message keys" transferred between
changes of "public key / private key" pairs is protected by those keys.

PSRG WORKSHOP ON NETWORK AND DISTRIBUTED SYSTEM SECURITY
  Feb. 11-12, 1993

  Attend the First PSRG Workshop on Network and Distributed
  System Security, which will bring together researchers
  and developers to share their experience in this field.
  Sponsored by Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and
  the Internet Society, the workshop will emphasize actual
  practical experience in building systems, rather than
  theoretical results. This is likely to be the first in a
  series of annual meetings.

BEAUTIFUL SAN DIEGO

  The workshop venue is the Catamaran Resort Hotel,
  providing 7 acres of gorgeous surroundings, facing
  Mission Bay and only 100 yards from beautiful Pacific
  Ocean beaches. Spouses and family members can catch a
  convenient Harbor Hopper for a quick trip to Sea World.
  After the workshop, plan to spend the weekend visiting La
  Jolla, the world famous San Diego Zoo or Mexico, only 30
  minutes by car or Trolley.
  
  A limited number of rooms have been reserved at the
  Catamaran for the very special rate of $77 single, $87
  double. Reservations can be made by calling
  (800) 288-0770 and indicating you are attending the PSRG
  Workshop. Reservations must be made before January 10,
  1993 to ensure this rate.

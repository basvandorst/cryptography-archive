The paperback edition has less than 1/2 of the book in it!  All
the technical detail was omitted.  If you are just interested in
the history, then the paperback is fine, but if you want any of
the mathematics, then you must have the full book.   Note - the
full book is not written for mathematicians - it is NOT a theory
book - it just has enough math to explain some of the material
to a "Scientific American" type of audience.  The paperback is
aimed more at a "Time" magazine audience.

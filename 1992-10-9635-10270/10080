Actually, I believe we *do* need a trusted, non-government repository
of encrypted information.  However, instead of storing my keys (since
I'm not a lawbreaker and never will be), we should store information
from groups of people with an established criminal record.

I have in mind logging (in safely encrypted form, with keys available
only by court order and only for criminal investigations) all
communications by the National Security Council and other Executive
Branch agencies (especially the White House, the CIA and the NSA).


I would even volunteer to run this service.

I can be trusted.

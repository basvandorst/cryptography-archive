This is the Diffie-Merkle patent.  It is owned by PKP as well as the
first Hellman-Diffie-Merkle patent 4,200,770.  These did in fact precede
RSA but since PKP owns them anyway, it doesn't matter.  I believe though
that it does matter that the second patent claims something invented
in the first but not specifically claimed, the entire concept of public
key.  There is opinion that the claims in the second patent would not
stand anyway because the knapsack method described as an embodyment is
not in fact secure and as such isn't a valid method of cryptography.

That's what sucks about this patent system, it doesn't matter really
whether the patent is valid, what matters is whether one has the money
to prove it isn't.  I'm not sure what the answer to that problem is 
either.  Consortium anyone?

Whether you know better or not, there are quite a few people who really do
believe what you've written above.  For the benefit of those people I must
ask how, if the only use of a gun is to kill lots of innocent people, can
the creation of an army be justified?

Either of them, in the hands of the people at large, make it more difficult
for a totalitarian government to control its subjects.

That depends on what you mean by "work".  We seem to agree that the
restrictions we're talking about won't do what their backers claim:
prevent large criminal organizations from using very advanced cryptography.
They could, however, stop people like me; I'm worried that that's the
point.

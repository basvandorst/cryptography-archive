The algorithm was originally called PES, and was introduced at EUROCRYPT '90:
"A Proposal for a New Blcok Encryption Standard," Lai & Massey.

The following year, at EUROCRYPT '91, the algorithm was modified to make it
more resistant to differential cryptanalysis, and renamed IPES:  "Markov 
Ciphers and Differential Cryptanalysis," Lai & Massey.

Since then it has been renamed IDEA.

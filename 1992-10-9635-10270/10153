Well, a lot of us have been convinced for some time that an attempt to
control what drugs people voluntarily consume is also pointless.  That
hasn't stopped our government (and yours also) from trying to do so.

Ah, we're way ahead of you here.  We've (drum roll, please) *passed a law*
making it illegal to sell radio receiver equipment capable of intercepting
cellular telephone calls, except to police and military.  Unfortunatly,
our governemnt lacks the authority to go after news organizations which
violate that law, or receive tips from others that do.  Perhaps if you
adopt our laws regarding communication equipment, and we adopt yours about
government control of the press, then both our governments will be happy.

You forget that our respective governments have the power to tax us to pay
for special police-and-military-only secure communication systems.  Think
how many jobs it will create when *all* branches of federal government and
not just the military can pay $1,200 for a telephone.  Why I bet they could
even fund it with a special tax on *our* telephone rates.

Please excuse all the sarcasm here, but I have no faith that the obvious
pointlessness of some program is any effective deterrent to a government's
tendency to pursue it.  As Prohibition and the War on Drugs have shown,
a serious government attempt to do something impossible can cause a lot
of what the military types call "collateral damage".

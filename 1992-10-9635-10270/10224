At Crypto 92, S. Micali proposed someting he called a "Fair Cryptosystem."
This is a public-key cryptosystem with the added property that the secret key
can be divided up into pieces.  Putting the pieces together will recover the
secret key.  However, unlike normal secret sharing schemes, the holder of one
of the pieces can convince himself that the piece is valid.

The thought behind this is that pieces are handed out to various parties:
the FBI, the Supreme Court, the ACLU, etc., and a court order is rqeuired to
bring all the pieces together and recover the secret key.

Neat mathematics, and it works.

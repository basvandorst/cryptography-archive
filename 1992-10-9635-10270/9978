FYI, the following notice regarding NIST's five year review of the DES
appeared in the U.S. Federal Register (Vol. 57, No. 177) on Friday,
September 11, 1992.  (I suspect that like I, most sci.crypt readers
don't also read the Federal Register;  fortunately I heard about the
notice and was able to get a copy from NIST.)

Of notable interest is the third of the three specified alternatives
for which NIST invites comments, namely the potential revision of the
applicability and/or implementation statements of the standard.

NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY

[Docket No. 920801-2201]

PROPOSED REAFFIRMATION OF FEDERAL INFORMATION PROCESSING STANDARD
(FIPS) 46-1, DATA ENCRYPTION STANDARD (DES)

AGENCY: National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST),
Commerce.

ACTION: Notice; request for comments.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

SUMMARY: Federal Information Processing Standard 46, Data Encryption
Standard, issued in 1977, provides an algorithm to be implemented in
electronic hardware devices and used for the cryptographic protection
of computer data.  The standard provided that it be reviewed within
five (5) years to assess its adequacy.  The first review was completed
in 1983, and the standard was reaffirmed for Federal government use (48
FR 41062 dated September 13, 1983).  The second review was completed in
1987, and the standard was reaffirmed for Federal government use (52 FR
7006).

     The purpose of this notice is to announce the review to assess the
continued adequacy of the standard to protect computer data.  Comments
from industry and the public are invited on the following alternatives
for FIPS 46-1.  The costs (impacts) and benefits of these alternatives
should be included in the comments:

--Reaffirm the standard for another five (5) years.  The National
  Institute of Standards and Technology would continue to validate
  equipment that implements the standard.  FIPS 46-1 would continue to
  be the only approved method for protecting unclassified computer
  data.

--Withdraw the standard.  The National Institute of Standards and
  Technology would no longer continue to support the standard.
  Organizations could continue to utilize existing equipment that
  implements the standard.  Other standards could be issued by NIST as
  a replacement for the DES.

--Revise the applicability and/or implementation statements of the
  standard.  Such revisions could include changing the standard to
  allow the use of implementations of the DES in software as well as
  hardware; to allow the iterative use of the DES in specific
  applications; to allow the use of alternative algorithms that are
  approved and registered by NIST.

     Interested parties may obtain a copy of FIPS 46-1 from the
National Technical Information Service (NTIS), 5285 Port Royal Road,
Springfield, VA  22161, telephone (703) 487-4650.

DATES:  Comments on this review of FIPS 46-1 must be received on or
before December 10, 1992.

ADDRESSES:  Written comments concerning this standard should be sent
to:  Director, Computer Systems Laboratory, ATTN: Review of FIPS 46-1.
Technology Building, room B-154, National Institute of Standards and
Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.

     Written comments received in response to this notice will be made
part of the public record and will be made available for inspection and
copying in the Central Reference and Records Inspection Facility, room
6020, Herbert C. Hoover Building, 14th Street between Pennsylvania and
Constitution Avenues NW., Washington, DC 20230.

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:  Mr. Miles Smid (301-975-2938) or
Donna F. Dodson (301-975-2921), National Institute of Standards and
Technology, Gaithersburg, MD 20899.

Dated: September 4, 1992.

John W Lyons,

Director.

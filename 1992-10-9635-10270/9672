The patent contains as claim 33:

	In a communication system an encoding means for transforming a
	transmit message word signal M to a ciphertext word signal C
	where M corresponds to a number representative of a message and

		0 <= M <= n-1

	where n is a composite number and where C corresponds to a number
	representative of an enciphered form of said message and corresponds
	to

		C = a[e]*M^e + a[e-1]*M^(e-1) + ... a[0](mod n)

	where e and a[e], a[e-1], ... a[0] are numbers.

Claim 37 is nearly identical except that cryptographic use is specifically
claimed.

Thus it appears that any cryptographic method using a polynomial modulo
a composite infringes.  I am seeking opinions, particularly from any
legal experts that may read this as to whether this claim which essentially
claims the use of a single mathematical formula is defensable?

Further I would like to know if anyone is aware of any prior art (filing
was Dec. 14, 1977) using a polynomial as simple as C = M^2(mod n) even that 
would invalidate this claim.

Thanks,

Bob

"Routinely", now that is an interesting proof requirement.  While it is
true that there are numerous cases of law enforcement officers illegally
using wiretaps, I don't now how many cases it takes before someone would
consider it "routine."

For a "recent" case of law enforcement officers using illegal wiretaps
see the New York Times, Nov 11, 1991, "Illegal wiretaps shake Missouri
Highway Patrol; 5 senior officers face disciplinary action."

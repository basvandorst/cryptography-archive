Jason Yanowitz posts a piece of political propaganda in which he claims,
among other things, that Leonard Peltier is still in jail for a
crime he did not commit.

First, I thought the issue was whether the crime was justified, not
whether Peltier committed it.

Second, even if Yanowitz is right about the issue, surely it's his
opinion that Peltier didn't commit the crime. Isn't that why we
have courts and juries, rather than Yanowitz, to decide the
guilt or innocence of the accused?

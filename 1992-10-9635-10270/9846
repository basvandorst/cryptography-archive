A common speedup is to use an extremely small encryption exponent, such
as 3.  I believe Knuth even proposed this at one point.  Raising something
to the third power is *VERY* much faster than raising to large powers.
Unfortunately, a corresponding decryption exponent will necessarily (it
seems) be very large, and the modular exponentiation will be correspondingly
hugely slower.

The big problem with a small exponent is if you use it to communicate with
more than "n" people, where "n" is the encryption exponent, but the details
have been lost as I read the paper on that quite some time ago.

Also, if it is known by an enemy that many of your plaintext blocks
happen to contain very small numbers (lots of leading zeros) then
cubing it isn't different than cubing mod m.  Then just take the integer
cube root, and you've decrypted that block.  Rare, though.  (In any case,
avoid blocks equal to zero).

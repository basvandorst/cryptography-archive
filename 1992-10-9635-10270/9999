How do you know there haven't been any "problems"? (You think the 
opposition would _tell_ you? :-)

Has your method been, say, tested by a tiger team with NSA signal
processing competence?

On a more mundane level: "allocatable"? Indeed. And what about
coverage of the whole surface area of the disk? In BOTH dimensions?
On (to use an old example) a CDC removable pack, ordinary offset
recovery (reading the track offset by +- n * 100 microns) will
often read the _previous_ contents of a sector with no uncorrectable
ECC errors. (It helps to play with .. ahg, um, never mind!)

Practical advice: if you ship s/w on tape or disk, don't EVER allow
use of anything but brand-new media, never used to write any data
you care about keeping secret from sophisticated opposition.

Don't get me wrong here: zeroing the content of the (allocatable,
formatted) sectors of the hard disk not being used is very useful.
But against the kind of opposition that might find the PRNG pattern
"harder" than all-zeroes, the method isn't really useful at all.

	This perhaps bring up the similar concept of cryptographically
secure pseudo-random number generators.  I remember reading one
scheme [Vazirani? or Blum?] which uses the equation
x[i+1] = x[i-1] ^ (x[i] * x[i]) mod N
where ^ is the xor operator, an indispensable operation.  Only a
fraction of the bits are secure ... on the order of Sqrt[ Log[2., N] ],
though this may be off by a constant.  You may produce a potentially
infinite series of secure bits ... and other useful properties.
	Anyone have better references?

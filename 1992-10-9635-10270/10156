There has been an awful lot of very thoughtful and interesting dialogue
about Prof. Denning's proposal (IMHO).  However, I believe the vast
majority of it is "preaching to the converted".  Isn't it time to start
"preaching to the heathens"?  In other words, if you feel strongly about
this, mail a letter to your Congressmen!

I realize that some people may consider this to be a bit premature.
However, I think the best way to kill something like this is in its
infancy, before it gets moving.

ps. This has a world distribution since I have seen interest from various
other nations (notably Finland, France, & Canada) about this subject.

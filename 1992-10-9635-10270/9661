Book ciphers can and have been broken.  William Friedman broke
one in the 1930s without even knowing what book had been used!

Before proposing cipher schemes, everyone should have completed
the assigned required reading of David Kahn's, The Codebreakers.
While the book is somewhat dated (it predates the declassification
of the Ultra work in WWII), it is an excellent history of 
cryptography from ancient times up until (nearly) today.  Be
sure to read the hardcover edition.  The paperback edition
was severely abridged.  The book should be available in
any good library.

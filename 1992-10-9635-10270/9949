For Macintosh users, I've written a small
application that does exactly as H. Shrikumar
suggests, that is, writing to the entire
allocatable hard disk a stream of pseudo
random bits generated by an extremely
long period additive RNG.

I've used it for several years without any
problems; it is extremely quick.  For
a free copy, Mac users can send me
a disk, a SASE (or two IRCs).

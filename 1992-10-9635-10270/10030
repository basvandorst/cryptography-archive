I saw that in RISKS and had trouble believing my eyes.

Exactly.

During the Bork hearings, people kept asking how he stood on the
constitutional right to privacy.  I kept thinking about abortion and
contraception at the time -- privacy of consenting adults to have protected
sex and privacy of a woman and her doctor do decide what she does with her
own body.

It never occurred to me that plain vanilla privacy (my sealed envelopes to
my buddy in CA) might be threatened -- but it's probably the same thing.

As far as I could tell from the debate, it's *not clear* that there is a
right to privacy in this country.  We know there isn't one in the UK, or so
I'm told, and much of our law was inherited from England.

And if you're caught with the machinery for hiding bits, that's evidence
that you're a crook, unless you can prove that you've registered with Big
Brother like a good boy or girl.

During the 1940's and 1950's, if you were caught with a hidden pad of
random numbers, the next step was the electric chair for you, the Communist
Spy.

...but if we were to propose a constitutional amendment to establish the
right to privacy, it wouldn't have a prayer of passing.  Not only would
the anti-abortion lobby be against it, the law-and-order folks would
come down hard on it.

After all -- we're guaranteed the right to free, public speech.  We're
allowed to stand on soap boxes and preach all sorts of nonsense.  We're
allowed to have rallies.  But we're not allowed to gather in secret and
whisper among ourselves.  That's a suspected criminal conspiracy.  Only the
Executive Branch is allowed to do that (maybe Congress also).


What's the next step?

Anyone out there have the political savvy to address this?

                ============================================
                PKWARE Inc. announces the Encryption Contest
                ============================================

    The strength of the encryption scheme in PKZIP has come under some
    scrutiny lately.  There have been allegations that the encryption
    method used is open to defeat by a "brute force" attack: that is
    simply trying every possible combination of characters until you
    find the one that was used.

    In response, we offer this challenge.  Decrypt the file BREAKME.DAT
    in the enclosed encrypted ZIP file: PKCONTST.ZIP

    The first person to respond with the correct answer will win.
    THE PRIZE TO THE FIRST PERSON WHO DOES IT WILL BE U.S.D. $1000.00

    This contest is subject to the following conditions:

    1) A winning entry consists of:

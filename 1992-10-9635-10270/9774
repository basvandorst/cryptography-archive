How do you know if your encryption method is safe (unbroken?)
Say you develope a method and you send messages.  How do you know whether or
not someone has broken it? 

Do you post messages and challenge people to break the code?
Do you send a message out of the country with a provocative content and 
then wait for the FBI to pay you a visit?

If you don't know that your code is secure, then you really don't
have a secure method, you just have to hope what you send isn't going to be
monitored by anyone who wants to and can crack it.

I wish it were so.  A few years ago the majority of those answering a poll
said that they thought the police should be able to search a private
residence, without benefit of permission or warrant, if they suspected
they would find drugs on the premises.  The bulk of my non-techncially-
astute friends find it odd that there is a perceived need for privacy in
communications:  "If I'm not doing anything illegal, why should I be
concerned if the government reads my email?"  They have never heard of
forfeiture laws or INSLAW or Operation Sundevil, and they believe it is
hype when you try to explain such things to them:  "Gee, if it really
happened like you said, it doesn't seem right. (Yawn)"

Unfortunately, I believe that the education of the general public on such
issues as fundamental civil liberties and personal privacy is something
that will only come about when the abuse becomes so heinous as to cause
significant debate (like McCarthyism of the 1950's), or civil disobedience
(a la the civil rights movement of the 1960's).  As it stands right now,
the average person doesn't care about such things, and doesn't want to
know.

There's a team of people working on a lengthy and ambitious FAQ
for sci.crypt.  I think you'll be pleased by the result when it's
released.  The size of the project makes it difficult to predict
when it will be complete, though.
The volunteers who are working on the FAQ (I am not amoung them)
deserve your thanks.

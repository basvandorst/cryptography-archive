I would normally agree with you, Mr. Atkinson, but this is an
exceptional case. This is not a philosophical issue -- the issue
involved is very much one of life and death, and the people who are
most concerned are precisely those people who are on sci.crypt. I
realize this discussion violates the group charter, but it is of such
intense concern to the cryptography community that this is likely the
most appropriate place for the discussion to occur.

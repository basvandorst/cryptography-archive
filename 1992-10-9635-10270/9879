I and a friend of mine are writing encrypting device for Commodore
Amiga and we would like to use IDEA (from PGP20) for encryption.

This device looks like hard disk to to applications and can be
mounted and formatted like hd. All data is physically stored in 
a file on 'real' hd/floppy. Device uses 512 byte blocks. Each block 
is encrypted in cipher feedback mode. Initial ivec for each block 
is generated from block number. Would it make system stronger if
ivecs are generated by encrypting block numbers?

How vulnerable IDEA/cfb is to known plaintext attack? Formatted file-
system contains lots of known plaintext data and block numbers are
known of course. Does that we use different ivec for each block help?
Other weaknesses? I have a terrible feeling that I misunderstood
cfb algorithm when I wrote a re-entrant version... if two blocks are
encrypted with same key and same ivec and one block starts with known
plaintext, then eoring blocks and known text gives 64 bits of plaintext
from other block (or plaintexts eored) Or is that just my confusion...

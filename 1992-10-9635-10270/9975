One might want to add:
	
	"Military cryptanalytics" by W.F. Friedman and L.D. Callimahos.
	Part 1, volume 2 contains extensive frequency data for English
	(military telegrams) and some info on French, German, Spanish,
	Italian, Portugese and (surprise, surprise...) Russian.
	Part 1 and 2 are available from Aegean Park Press, at a
	horrendous price.
	Does anyone know the status of parts 3 to 6?
	Did Friedman and Callimahos 'do a Knuth', only finishing the
	first two parts, or are the later parts still classified?

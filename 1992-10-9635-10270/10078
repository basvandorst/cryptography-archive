In the context of this discussion it should be noted that -- at least in
this country, but probably elsewhere as well -- the post office people
are discouraging their customers from sending "old-fashioned" letters.
By increasing the fees and cutting on the service they actually force
business customers to switch to fax (or e-mail) communications, and the
same will apply to the private sector before long.

While routine screening or tapping of conventional mail is cumbersome
and expensive, it is very easy to record electronic communications for
immediate or later analysis (and decryption).

It would (IMHO) be paranoid to assume that the security agencies were
responsible for the deterioration of the postal services -- there are
a lot of more practical reasons involved. The fact, however, that we'll
totally depend on electronic communications in the near future makes the
privacy of these communications an absolutely vital point, and we have
to fight for it as long as the alternatives still exist.

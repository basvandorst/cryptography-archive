please correct me if i'm wrong, but in reading the FAQ my mind started
to boggle & i need to clarify this:

   1. RSA is pretty much a standard in Europe.
   2. it is illegal to export RSA stuff from the US.

now i've always thought the US government was a bit bass ackwards,
but this is just silly.

am i reading this right? if it's true why is export of encryption
schemes so much of a problem? apparently they're already out there.

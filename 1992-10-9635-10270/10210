Well, almost every paragraph of Bamford's book as a nice reference,
telling where exactly the fact discussed was obtained from.

So - if somebody is really concerned about NSA repotation (or
just wants to know) - did anybody try to compare at least one
case, described by Bamford, with the sources he refers to? It
should pretty much either shut up those who claim that book 
isn't accurate, or discredit Mr. Bamford and his book.

Now - anybody takes the challenge? (:-)

Another useful book (if you can find it) is:

Cryptanalysis for Microcomputers
by Caxton C. Foster
Hayden Book Company, 1982
ISBN 0-8104-5174-3

It's got letter frequency, terminal and initial letter frequncies,
Digraph table (both ignoring and resecting word boundaries)
a list of the top 1000 words from the Brown University Corpus
etc, etc

The code in the book is in PET 2001 BASIC. It's pretty awful, but
it's at least a starting point.

One of the more useful tables, if you ever type it in is a letter
pattern table (ie words with the pattern AABCD are AARON, LLOYD and 
OOZED)

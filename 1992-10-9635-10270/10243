			------------------------

	Interest in numbers of the form 2^p-1 (Mersenne numbers) and
2^2^n+1 (Fermat numbers) arose naturally in the context of certain
problems. Interest in Mersenne numbers arose as a result of the search
for perfect numbers, i.e. numbers that are the sum of their proper divisors.
Interest in Fermat numbers arose in analyzing when one could contruct a
regular polygon of n sides with ruler and compass. What interested
early mathematicians was when these numbers were prime.

	It is only natural that this interest would extended more
generally to numbers of the form a^n + 1, and a^n -1, especially
after the discovery of finite fields and the discovery that they
arise naturally in the study of Fermat's Last Theorem. (and other areas
as well)

	In 1925 Lt.-Col. Alan J.C. Cunningham and H.J. Woodall gathered
together all that was known about the primality and factorization of
such numbers and published a small book of tables. "These tables
collected from scattered sources the known prime factors for the
bases 2 and 10 and also presented the authors' results of thirty
years' work with these and the other bases" (see [1])

	Since 1925 many people have worked on filling in these
tables. It is likely that this project is the longest, ongoing
computational project in history. D.H. Lehmer, a well known
mathematician who passed away in 1991 was for many years a leader
of these efforts. Professor Lehmer was a mathematician who was at
the forefront of computing as modern electronic computers became
a reality. He was also known as the inventor of some ingenious
pre-electronic computing devices specifically designed for factoring
numbers. These devices are currently in storage at the Computer
Museum in Boston. 

	For a history of this project I suggest you obtain a
copy of:
 
[1]:

J. Brillhart, D.H. Lehmer, J. Selfridge, S.S. Wagstaff Jr., & B. Tuckerman
Contemporary Mathematics vol 22, "Factorizations of b^n +/- 1,
b = 2,3,5,6,7,10,11,12 up to high powers", published by the American
Math. Society 1983,  2nd Edition 1988


	It is with a great deal of pleasure, and also with a certain
sadness that I announce that this little book, begun in 1925, has
at last been completely filled in. [although the original tables
have since been extended]. The last number factored was a 116-digit
cofactor of 2^485 + 1.  It is safe to say that this project has
burned more CPU cycles than any other computation in history. A list
of contributors would be too long to list here, but is given in the book.

	A special issue of Mathematics of Computation will be devoted and
dedicated to Professor Lehmer in July, 1993 and a public announcement of
the completion of the original book will be made in that issue. Too many
people have contributed to this project to list them here, but special credit
should go to Bob Baillie, Richard Brent, Arjen Lenstra, Mark Manasse, Peter 
Montgomery, Sam Wagstaff Jr., and myself, because these people have provided 
over 2500 results to this project over the last six years. Others that have 
contributed include Oliver Atkin & Neil Rickert,  Duncan Buell, Harvey Dubner, 
Jim Davis, Hiromi Suyama, Herman teRiele, Yuji Kida, and  'Red' Alford. 
 
	This does not mention the many contributors who worked diligently 
prior to 1980.  Attributes to these people are given in the book.  Special 
thanks should also go to John Brillhart, Hendrik Lenstra, John Pollard, and
Carl Pomerance for providing much of the theoretical impetus to these results.
I hope I have not slighted anyone else by failing to mention them here.
 
	I would like to give my special thanks to the Research Computer
Facility at MITRE Corporation and its staff for providing a significant
portion of the resources that allowed the original book to be completed.


========================================================================
I summarize what is known here: The table below gives the limit N,
such that all numbers of the form a^k+1 and a^k-1 for k<N have been
completely factored.

Note that the bases greater than 12 have NOT been subjected to the
same level of effort as the smaller bases. Richard Brent also has
done some work on bases > 30. I also have worked on numbers of the form 
a^n + b^n  with (a,b) = 1 for a<=10 and have data on those as well.

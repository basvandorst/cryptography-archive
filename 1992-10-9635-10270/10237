I do think it should be this way, in principle.  But somehow, it seems
that many other countries than USA are moving in the direction of more
freedom or at least staying the same (even with no good ideologic or
constitutional basis or the ideals said aloud by anyone), while USA
with a seemingly very good Constitution is rapidly turning into a
"let-the-big-brother-gummint-control-everything" country.  The reasons
for this are somewhat unclear to me.

Someone put it this way: "While the ex-Soviet Union is trying to turn
into what USA was twenty years ago, USA is trying to turn into what
Soviet Union was twenty years ago".

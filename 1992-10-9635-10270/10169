An FBI friend of mine who is well aware of these issues suspects that
it is the Baby Bells who have been responsible for some of the recent
wiretapping legislation.  As he understands it, whereas now the phone
companies get no (or little) remuneration for allowing law enforcement
access for wiretapping, the new bills not only require the technical
means to access communications, but also require the government to pay
for those means.

To wit:  Wiretapping, it's not illegal, it's a growth market.

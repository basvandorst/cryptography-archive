Perhaps this is not the right place to make this posting...

I am looking for publicly available data encryption software
that implements DES. I remember seeing a package called "FastDES" but I am
unable to locate this program. Any help would be appreciated.

Thanks. Please reply by Email to ahn@wfunet.wfu.edu or post to sci.crypt.

	   The Classics on letter frequency are


	   _SECRET AND URGENT_, by Fletcher Pratt, Blue Ribbon Books, 1943

	   Cryptography The Science of Secret Writing,  1943.
							^^^^
	   Codes and Secret Writing.... 
	   Cryptanalysis  by  Helen F. Gaines ...


alll of these were written before computers were popular and thus are
entirely suspect.  i imagine none of them mention that he most common
character is a space (which it certainly is in real english text).


in fact, the classic source for byte frequencies is plaintext of the
sort you are looking for.

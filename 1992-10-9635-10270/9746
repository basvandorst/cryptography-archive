The mail server source of pgp2.0 was corrupt;
the Northern Lights version of pgp source
via xmodem was non-existent.

I am offering a $10 reward to the first
person who sends me a disk containing
the pgp2.0 source and executable.

I'll even return the postage and the
disk!

And on the return disk I'll put
a fast table driven DES source
and two (count em), two versions
of Lucifer.

Tnx ahead of time.

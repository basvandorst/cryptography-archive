Here's some information on cryptology-related journals.
I gathered this in Fall 1991, so some of it may be out-of-date.

Journal of Cryptology
Springer-Verlag New York, Inc.
Service Center Secaucus
44 Hartz Way
Secaucus, NJ  07094  USA
(201)348-4033

$87/year + $8 postage & handling.  Published three times a year.
Scholarly journal.  
 

Cryptosystems Journal
Tony Patti, Editor and Publisher
P. O. Box 188
Newtown, PA  18940-0188  USA
(215)579-9888    tony_s_patti@cup.portal.com

$45/year.  Published three times a year.
Journal dedicated to the implementation of cryptographic systems
on IBM PCs.  Emphasis on tutorial/pragmatic aspects.  Evidently
all articles are written by the publisher.  


CRYPTOLOGIA
Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology
Terre Haute, IN  47803  USA

$34/year.  Published four times a year.
Blend of cryptlogical history and technique, including some modern 
techniques.  Edited by such well-known figures as David Kahn and Cipher
Devours.  This is not the place where the latest breakthroughs
are published, though.


The Cryptogram
Journal of the American Cryptogram Association
P. O. Box 6454 
Silver Spring, MD  20906

Available by joining the ACA; dues are probably about $20/year by now.
Published six times a year.  
Contains mostly puzzles for you to solve.  No techniques invented
after 1920 are used, with simple substitution being the most common.
Also contains articles on classical cryptosystems, and book reviews.
Not a scholarly journal.


The Cryptogram Computer Supplement
Dan Veeneman
P. O. Box 7
Burlington, IL  60109  USA

$2.50/issue.  Published three times a year for ACA members.
Newsletter for computer hobbyist members of the ACA.


The Public Key
George H. Foot, Editor
Waterfall, Uvedale Road
Oxted, Surry  RH8 0EW
United Kingdom

(Cost unknown.)
Magazine devoted to public key cryptography, especially amoungst
personal computer owners.  [Note that RSA's patents do not apply in
Europe, hence the existence of this magazine.]
 

Also of interest:

IEEE Transactions on Information Theory.
(Address and price not handy at the moment.)

Not a crypto journal, of course, but occasionally contains articles of
major cryptologic significance.


The Transactions of The Institute of Electronics, Information and 
Communication Engineers ( IEICE )
English edition of this Japanese journal available through:
Maruzen Co., Ltd.
P.O. Box 5050, Tokyo International
100 - 31, Japan

$10/issue or $120/year.  Published twelve times a year.  Similar to
IEEE Trans on Information Theory.  The June 90 edition is entirely
devoted to cryptography.


Aegean Park Press
P. O. Box 2837
Laguna Hills, CA  92654-0837

Publishers of books on cryptology, mostly reprints of fairly advanced
texts on classical cryptology.  (Including over 15 books by the famous
WW II cryptologists Friedman, Callimahos, and Kullback).

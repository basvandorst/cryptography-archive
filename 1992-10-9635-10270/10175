I'm pretty sure that IPES is know as IDEA these days.

No.  In [1] it is mentioned that Differential Cryptanalysis can
break Feal-8 with less than 2000 cipher texts in a chosen plaintext
attack.  Also [2] demonstrates a known plaintext attack on Feal-4
and Feal-6 which use about 1000 and 2000 (respectively) plaintext
blocks, which suggests that Feal-8 might be vulnerable to known
plaintext attacks also.

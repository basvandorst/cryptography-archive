While having the keys held by a TIA rather than the government is a
good start, some people seem to feel that it is insufficient.  To
satisfy these concerns, I propose that the keys be held by a VTVIA:
a Very Trustworthy Very Independent Agency.

Seriously, does anyone believe that calling it a "TIA" makes it
anything other than an arm of the government, whose sole purpose is
to let the government read my mail?  There's no need for bribery
here; I'm sure FBI and TIA counterparts would quickly develop
"working relationships".

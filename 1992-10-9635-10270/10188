We already have a big rights problem and don't need anyone making it worse.

In the UK, the Securities and Investment Board (which is a private company) 
has greater powers of investigation than the police; for example, it can 
compel testimony without a warrant.

If they want to, they can force you to hand over crypto keys just like that. 
They can also delegate powers to recognised professional bodies such as the 
Law Society, and to recognised clearing houses.

What is this all for?

FACT: Since insider trading was made an offence in 1980 and this mechanism
was set up to deal with it, there have been 285 cases, which have led to
23 prosecutions and 13 convictions. Of these convictions, all but one were 
on pleas of guilty, and the majority resulted in fines less than the
amount of illicit profit made.

Is SIB a cover for the spooks, or what?

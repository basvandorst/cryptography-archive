That has a high turn arround cost, but here's an idea.  How about using
the existing CD's as a pad?  Imagine this.  You take the output of an
existing CD and convert it from the time domain to the frequency domain.
Here, you shift the different frequencies by different ammounts.  Next,
convert it back into the time domain.  The output would have to be
recorded on a DAT or writeabe CD.  What makes this idea useful is that
if the music is fairly, well, alternative, it would look like a simple
bootleg copy.  A little believable sin customs might not mind.  To
decode, your compatriot receives your DAT and then goes out and gets a
copy of the CD that matches it.  After that, it's trivial.

There are a few problems with this idea.  Often, an artist will release
different cuts of the same piece in different geographic locations.
This is one reason that using a small artist will help.  They won't be
as likely to be able to afford to do that.

One nice strength of this process is that the DAT that you produce will
look like a Digital-Analog-Digital copy.  They will *expect* some phase
errors. :)  Since the encoding process takes place entirely in the
digital domain, you can precisely control the amount of distortion.
This could get realy hard to distinguish from random fluctuations such
as may have occured in our ficticous recording and playback machines.
Simple. :)

My friendly neighbourhood Microsoft salesperson was by my office the
other day. One of the "features" he mentioned was that the mail in
MS-Mail was encrypted while in transit or in the message stores. With
typical bravado and hyperbole he said: "It can't be broken"

Of course WE know better. So .....

Does anyone know anything about the encryption scheme used by MS-Mail ??

Just how easy is it to break ?? Can anyone demonstrate this ??

Curious as always.

Hello,

	As a relative newcommer to here I am interested in some general
information on public encryption key, private decryption key systems. Also, I
would like to get my hands on some source code for such a system. The
application I have in mind is to place this code into the mail path such that
incomming e-mail is encrypted and you must supply the decryption key to read
your mail thus defeating mail searches by the undesirable who may have gained
access to your system.

	Any comments are welcome, and thanks. Ethan

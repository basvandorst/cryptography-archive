Conference facilities.  The conference will be held on the campus
of Somerset College, Mudgeeraba, situated in the Gold Coast

of lower accommodation costs and better availability. Please book
your own accommodation or take advantage of the booking service,
as detailed separately. Please return the Accommodation Booking
Form to the accommodation booking service at the address given.
The Registration Form needs to be separately sent to QUT at the
address given for registrations. (The registration form also asks
if you are using the Accommodation Booking Service to inform the
Organising Committee for bus allocation, etc.) Parking at
Somerset College is free.  Somerset College is a ten year old
independent co-educational school. The facilities of the college
will be available to attendees, including use of the library,
photocopying facilities, souvenir/stationary shop, computer
laboratories, etc. There will be no students present during
conference week.  Limited spaces will be available in the
Woodlands Pre-school for child-minding for children 2 - 5 years
old, from 7.45am to 5.45pm during the conference.  This school
is on land adjoining Somerset College. Please contact the General

during your stay.  Child-minding fees are $25.00 per day per
child and are your responsibility. Places are extremely limited
and early bookings are needed.

is some 90km south of Brisbane, the location of the nearest
international airport and 30km from Coolangatta/Gold Coast
airport, the local national airport. Bus transfers from Brisbane
or Coolangatta Airports to the Gold Coast area and to your
accommodation may be arranged by your travel agent or on arrival. 
All major Rental Car agencies operate at both airports. Full
information on bus / limousine transfers and related arrival /

A bus service will be arranged to convey participants from their

an arrangement is common for conferences on the Gold Coast. The

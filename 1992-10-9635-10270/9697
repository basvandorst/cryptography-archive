	   Not necessarily.  You want one that *looks* identical to "an 
	   unmodified, non-fancy, non-techno-geek, consumer [ etc. . . . ]"
	   If you are a spy and someone is suspicious enough to take apart
	   your TI calcuator you are in deep shit already.  


If they take apart your TI calculator and don't find anything,
you may be in deep shit but not as deep as if they *do* find something.

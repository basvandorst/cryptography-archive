Yes!

This is why the study of cryptology is so important and will be of
even more importance in the future.

The flaw here was one of protocol design (no doubt specifically
introduced in the movie to make the plot work) -- not one of having a
system which was hard to cryptanalyze.

It is our job as cryptologists to make sure that crypto protocols
controlling such things can not be subverted by major sources of
threat -- including those in the uniform and/or pay of the US Government.


I'm sure, BTW, that the NSA already addresses such problems in designing
real systems for the military.

It's our job to do the same in designing systems for industry.

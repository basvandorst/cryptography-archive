A few weeks ago in sci.crypt, I wrote:

} I would like to purchase a copy of the first edition _The Codebreakers_
} by David Kahn.

} If anyone has one to sell, please get in contact and we'll arrange a deal.

Here's the summary of responses.

First, I had a metoo from janm@bern.docs.uu.se:

} If you get multiple offers, I wouldn't mind getting in touch with a seller.

I've mailed him an offer.

Then, royg@osf.org told me:

}   It is in print here in the states. I just saw a copy in the bookstore 
} across the way. Kinda steep at 60 dollars (u.s) but then again it is worth 
} it.  Good luck.

and

}   The bookstore is :
}
}       Quantum Books
}       4 Cambridge Center
}       Cambridge Mass ( u.s.a ) 02142
} 
}       phone number is 617-494-5042
}       fax no. 617-577-7282 
}       email ( wow! ) quanbook@world.std.com
} 
}    I have no association with them except for the fact that they are 
} across the street from where I work ( different building, different 
} company ) and I've purchased a couple of books from them in the last 
} few years. They seem reputable and when I was there I noticed two
} copies on the shelf. ( the big book with dust cover, new ) I didn't 
} check the price.  Good luck. 

Armed with this information, I got Blackwells in Oxford to order it,
despite their protestations that it wasn't in print.  Eventually, they
told me once again that it wasn't in print and cancelled my order.

jac54@cas.org told me:

} 	There are two good sources of the Codebreakers over here.
} 	One of them may even have a signed copy, perhaps even anointed
} 	with oil that has been through Kahn's Hagelin machine.
}

} 	of first editions on hand.

} 	$75.00.
} 
} 	If you contact them, let them know how you got the addresses(sp?).

} 	Alec Chambers.

Finally, Ian W Moor <iwm@doc.imperial.ac.uk}, wrote:

The proprietor is Dr Bob Speer, who sounds a really nice bloke.

This was the copy I bought.

I hope this information proves useful to other searchers.

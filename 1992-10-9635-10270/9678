The problem with using some more obscure text is that the men wearing
dark suits are more likely to get suspicious if they notice that there's
several hundred people carrying around the same Harlequin romance.  With
the Bible, if the spy is a traveller, he wouldn't even have to carry one,
since most hotels have one in the bedside drawer (and for standardization
purposes, it might be wise to go with the "Gideon" standard of the NASB
Bible, which is the one in the hotels).

Another possibility would be for the spies to choose something based on
the #1 bestseller of the week (or maybe #2).  Nobody is surprised at the 
airport if they see someone carrying the latest Clancy book onto the 
plane...  it wouldn't be a bestseller if there weren't lots of people
that bought the book!  (Flames about the ways ``bestsellers'' are chosen
by the media will be cheerfully ignored ;-)

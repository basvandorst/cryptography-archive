Well, not quite.  In 1978, I (an otherwise ordinary citizen :^) owned a
4Mhz Z80-based CP/M personal computer system that I programmed with the
DES algorithm described in FIPS-46.  The cost of this system was well within
the means of middle-class America.  You'll have to look elsewhere for an
explanation.

This is important enough that this kind of nonsense neds to be refuted by as
many people as possible, so:

Those of you outside the USA (especially in the worker's paradise of Canada)
have a great interest in freedom of communication, which means the absense
of statist intervention in cryptography, among other things.  Surely if we
had freer and open communications it would be less possible to excuse your
prejudices against guns and cowboys by attributing it to ignorance and we'd
be more able to dispose of such claims by attributing them to blatant bigotry!

This is your fundamental error.  If government regulation of our lives for the
common good worked and was moral, the Canadian government wouldn't have to
regulate out of existence private hospitals.  This was done, in the words of
an anonymous official of the part of the Canadian government in charge of its
socialized medicine, "Because we will not brook superior competition," but I
paraphrase.  The Soviet Union would have prospered, not collapsed, and no
one would be rejecting socialism in Argentina, Estonia, Latvia, the Czech
Republic, Poland, former East Germany, etc.

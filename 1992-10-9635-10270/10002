If some kind soul could tell where I can get (buy) EUROCRYPT (88 - 92)
conference papers and/or CRYPTO papers, I would be highly pleased.
Their ISBN numbers cannot hurt me, so ...

Furthermore, knowledge about where and when these conferences are held
next time can be valuable information (to me), I just might be
interested in attending.

Please mail, I do not read news too often.

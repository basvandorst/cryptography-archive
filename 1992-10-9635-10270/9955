This is a updated version of the list I posted a few weeks ago.
Thanks to several correspondants who provided additional information.

Here's some information on cryptology-related journals and bookstores.

===== JOURNALS =====

$87/year + $8 postage & handling.  Published three times a year.
Scholarly journal.  
 

Cryptosystems Journal

(215)579-9888    tony_s_patti@cup.portal.com

$45/year.  Published three times a year.
Journal dedicated to the implementation of cryptographic systems
on IBM PCs.  Emphasis on tutorial/pragmatic aspects.  Evidently
all articles are written by the publisher.  


CRYPTOLOGIA
Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology
Terre Haute, IN  47803  USA

$34/year.  Published four times a year.
Blend of cryptlogical history and technique, including some modern 
techniques.  Edited by such well-known figures as David Kahn and Cipher
Devours.  This is not the place where the latest breakthroughs
are published, though.


FORBIDDEN KNOWLEDGE
PO BOX 770813
LAKEWOOD, OH 44107
        
$18 a year - make check m/o to Darren Smith (editor).
Jack Jeffries (cj137@cleveland.Freenet.Edu) says that this is a 
local publication which has articles on cryptology.  That's all
I know about it.


The Cryptogram
Journal of the American Cryptogram Association
P. O. Box 6454 
Silver Spring, MD  20906

Available by joining the ACA; dues are probably about $20/year by now.
Published six times a year.  
Contains mostly puzzles for you to solve.  No techniques invented
after 1920 are used, with simple substitution being the most common.
Also contains articles on classical cryptosystems, and book reviews.
Not a scholarly journal.


The Cryptogram Computer Supplement
Dan Veeneman
P. O. Box 7
Burlington, IL  60109  USA

$2.50/issue.  Published three times a year for ACA members.
Newsletter for computer hobbyist members of the ACA.


The Public Key
George H. Foot, Editor
Waterfall, Uvedale Road
Oxted, Surry  RH8 0EW
United Kingdom

(Cost unknown.)
Magazine devoted to public key cryptography, especially amoungst
personal computer owners.  [Note that RSA's patents do not apply in
Europe, hence the existence of this magazine.]
 

Also of interest:

IEEE Transactions on Information Theory.
(Address and price not handy at the moment.)

Not a crypto journal, of course, but occasionally contains articles of
major cryptologic significance.


The Transactions of The Institute of Electronics, Information and 
Communication Engineers ( IEICE )
English edition of this Japanese journal available through:
Maruzen Co., Ltd.
P.O. Box 5050, Tokyo International
100 - 31, Japan

$10/issue or $120/year.  Published twelve times a year.  Similar to
IEEE Trans on Information Theory.  The June 90 edition is entirely
devoted to cryptography.  Back issues are available.

===== BOOKSTORES / PUBLISHERS =====

Aegean Park Press
P. O. Box 2837
Laguna Hills, CA  92654-0837

Publishers of books on cryptology, mostly reprints of fairly advanced
texts on classical cryptology.  (Including over 15 books by the famous
WW II cryptologists Friedman, Callimahos, and Kullback).  They have
over 50 books related to cryptology, and a smaller number of books on
other areas such as military intelligence.  Recommended.


Alec Chambers (jac54@cas.org) adds the following bookstores:

National Intelligence Book Center

This is the only organization anywhere to act as a collecting
point for new books on topics such as espionage, crypto., and
computer security.  They scour the world for books and some will
be expensive because they air-freight everything in.  It is
easiest to contact them by phone:

202-785-4334
Fax: 202-785-7456.

You will probably talk to Elizabeth Bancroft (who runs the whole thing).

In addition, they have a publication called the "Surveillant" (6 issues/
year, $48.00) which announces new acquisitions and has some news
from the intelligence field.  Each issue comes with a check-off order
form for books announced in that issue.  It can be contacted at:

Surveillant,
Lock Box Mail Unit 18757
Washington, DC 20036-8757.


Second-hand Specialists:

There are four dealers who specialize in espionage and related fields
in the U.S.  I have dealt very happily with two of them (that's all I
can afford to support).  They are:

Cloak and Dagger Books
Dan D. Halpin Jr.
9 Eastman Ave
Bedford, NH 03110

603-668-1629
603-626-0626 (fax)

and

Elm Spy Books
Box 9753
Arnold, MD 21012

310-544-9014.

These two will buy, sell, and trade and to back order searches.  Elm
is interested in expanding coverage in crypto. and may be interested
in dealing.

Two others I have not dealt with, but who may be useful are:

The Last Hurrah Bookshop
937 Memorial Avenue
Williamsport, PA 17701

717-327-9338

and Ruth Koffsky Books (for whom I can't find an address right now)

I hope this is useful.  Encourage people to tell these sources
how they found out about them.  [i.e., from Alec Chambers]

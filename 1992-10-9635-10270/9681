What you have described is the classic "one time pad".  With advances
in mass storage techniques this is becoming progressively more attractive.
I recall a description in some novel (I think Clancy's "Patriot Games") of
a secure military manpack radio into which one inserts a card containing
a one-time pad.  Without a matching pad all you hear is white noise.
In the book a Bad Guy throws away the disk with the pad, leaving the
Good Guys in the jungles of Columbia listening to white noise...

I believe the problem with using a known irrational number and a secret
starting place as a key is that keys must be large to stop brute force
and I don't think there is a way to just start generating digits from
an arbitrary point without generating all the ones in between.  So while
it would work, it would be computationally infeasable.  Someone please
correct me if I am wrong.  I have wondered about this also.

Bob

Franklin Corp. is pleased to offer a new privacy-enhancing
communication system based on the "W.A.S.T.E." technology of Yoyodyne
Enterprises. This system features:

* Anonymous sending of messages.

* The ability to send extortion threats, bomb threats, and poison pen
messages with nearly no chance of detection.

* A way to send cash to politicians in exchange for their support.

* A means of transporting drugs, contraband, pornographic materials,
and other banned materials. 

We at Franklin Corp. call this secure system  "The U.S. Mail."

....

Seriously, would a system like the current postal delivery system ever
be allowed to start up in today's security state climate? A system
that demonstrably "allows" blackmail (note the term!), bribery of
officials, poison pen anonymous letters, and the aforementioned
shipment of contraband? A system that allows anyone to seal an
envelope and drop it off in the corner mailbox? (Sure, we all grew up
with tales of how Hoover's F.B.I. was able to trace messages to
specific typewriters, to track origins of letters, etc., but mostly
this was hype...the mail delivery system is essentially anonymous
for the sender.)

We should keep this in mind when considering the "reasonable"
suggestions of policy-makers to mandate registration of encryption
keys. Because _some_ people commit crimes using the mail system, would
we support a plan to require escrow depositing of all mail, all
letters, and perhaps even "sealing" of envelopes after inspection of
the contents? Not hardly. Some prices are too high to pay.

I have respect for Dorothy Denning, as I hope my initial posting
conveyed, but not for this particular idea. In any case, it's
important that we in this community thoroughly debate and critique
this idea, lest it suddenly appear in Congress as "S.666" or somesuch.

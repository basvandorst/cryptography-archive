"Network World"'s Sept. 28th issue, p. 25,  has a headline
"NIST reviews DES under microscope"

NIST says it has three options

Reaffirm DES for another 5 years, withdraw DES as a standard (and
possibly issue another standard), or revise guidelines for DES use
(including certifying DES software implementations).

For more info see the article.

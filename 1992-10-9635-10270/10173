This sounds awfully like the "snuff film" urban legend that's been
debunked many many times over on alt.folklore.urban.  

Ms. Denning: Either prove it with documentation or retract the
statement.  I don't need much, just the date and the city -- I can
look it up in the papers given that.

A snuff film is a film of a murder, where the purpose of murdering the
person is in order to get the murder on film.  Snuff films are RUMORED
to exist; it's RUMORED that bad people kidnap innocent victims and
kill them for the camera.  This has never been proven.

The acid test of "snuff-film-ness" is this: 

  If the camera ran out of film, would they postpone the murder?

If it doesn't meet this test, it's not a snuff film.  Murders happen
all the time -- that doesn't mean the snuff film rumor is true.

What is the "alternating group"? Does this mean that for any two 64 bit
words, x and y, there exists some sequence of DES transformations that
take x into y?, or that for any 1-1 onto mapping from the set of all {x}
to itself, there exists a sequence of DES which generates that mapping
(ie, that the DES group contains 2^(2^64) elements)?

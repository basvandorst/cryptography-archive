[For the readers of the crossposting to comp.os.os2.apps: PGP 2.0 is a
popular RSA (public key) encryption software.]

After talking about that I intended to make the OS/2 support in PGP 2.0
functioning again, I got several requests for executables. They are now
available for ftp:

Machine:	ftp.uni-erlangen.de	(german site)
Directory:	pub/pc/os2/fauern/crypt
File:		pgp20os2.zip

Please do not put this archive on a BBS or ftp server in the USA,
because it is encryption software and falls under the US export
restrictions for such software.

The contents is the same as in the MS-DOS executables archive
(documentation files) except that the DOS executable has been replaced
by two (16- and 32-bit) executables for OS/2. Both executables run under
plain DOS too. The 32-bit one needs a DOS extender (emx.exe) which is
included too and a DLL for use under OS/2 2.0 (emx.dll).

The differences to the standard source distribution is included as a
context diff and will be in the next version of pgp included.

Pat, really good stuff.  Where should we go from here?  Seems like a very 
practical interim step until the really definitive one shows up.  Should
we try and merge?  I don't see a lot of overlap between them.  If I post
again, do I need permission to add your excellent book list (I would
credit all three authors, is this enough?).  I think most of my questions
would be on the front since they cover the "getting started" part, but
I like most of the topics you covered & I should have included a
bibliography, which you already have done.  Suggestions?  

Does the group in charge of the definitive FAQ have any opinions or suggestions?

If both of these were assembled and posted betimes, I think it would save a lot
of bandwidth for now.  Together, they'd come out to about 1100 lines.

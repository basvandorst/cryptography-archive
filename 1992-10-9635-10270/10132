As has been pointed out here, Prof. Denning's proposal has
some minor flaws: malefactors might encrypt their nefarious
missives with their own unauthorized crypto systems before
encrypting them with the approved registered keys.

To address this issue I propose a slight modification of
Prof. Denning's scheme.  Since the Trustworthy Independent
Agency (TIA) will have all the necessary keys, it might as
well perform the actual encryption as an additional service
at little extra cost.  In other words, why not require that
all messages to be encrypted be submitted in plaintext to the
TIA for encryption?  To preserve constitutional safeguards,
the TIA would be required by law to disregard the actual contents
of the submitted messages, other than to check that the submissions
are not already encrypted.  The encryption and most of the checking
could be quickly done by automated software (eg. spell checkers, grammar
checkers) with a few dubious cases handled by TIA personnel.

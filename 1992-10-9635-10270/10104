	    If a "major threat" against society is being planned, then it
    had better be major ENOUGH to justify some other means of finding out
    what is being planned. Let's be realistic, here - if I had an H-bomb
    buried under Washington, DC, and you were REALLY sure it was me, do
    you think that someone would take the time to cryptanalyze my personal
    files on my workstation? No - that's when rubber hose cryptanalysis
    comes in.

Um, I dislike the proposal as much as anyone else who's posted here,
but I saw "Dr. Strangelove" on video a couple nights ago and exactly
this situation came up in that movie (all of you should see it if you
haven't).  General Jack D. Ripper launched a nuclear attack that could
only be recalled by a crypto key that only he knew.  Then, fearing
rubber hose cryptanalysis, he blew his brains out (why not?  He was
trying to blow up the world anyway...).  The good guys had to
work from his notepad to try to figure out the key.

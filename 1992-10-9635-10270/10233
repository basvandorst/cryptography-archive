They might stand up.  However, they would not benefit "the public welfare",
nor do they have rational justification as "police power".  It's too bad
Bork isn't on the court -- he would probably vote against such abuse of

regard taxes (clearly contrary to explicit wording of the Constitution, but
the Renquest and the Supremes disagree) and in drug-related seizure cases. 
The later is currently in dispute in the Federal Courts.

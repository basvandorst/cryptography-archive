There are some combinatorial results at your disposal here which can help in the
calculation of this LCM quantity. 

The longest cycle in a random permutation of N elements is expected to be 
approximately 0.62*N (Knuth v1); thus we expect more than 60% of the elements 
to be in a single cycle. Then for a 64-bit permutation we expect about 0.62*2^(64)
= 10^(20) elements to be in a single cycle. 

More properties of permutations, for example, are given in Knuth v2 and a book by 
R. Kemp called "Fundamentals of the average case analysis of particular algorithms".

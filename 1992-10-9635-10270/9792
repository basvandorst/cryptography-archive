Doubtful.  From what I've heard over and over and over again, you need
unzip1.10 (forgive me.. I'm not a PC person.. might be pkunzip1.10) to
unpack pgp20.zip

BTW, regarding your offer for someone to send you a copy of pgp2.0 for money.. 
This might be grounds for prosecution under copyright infringment laws in the 
USA.  At least that's how Phil's dicussion of PKP and their bass ackwards way 
of going about life.  I'd suggest upgrading your unzipper first and see
if that helps before you try getting someone wrapped up in a legal battle.

Along these lines I'd like to know if anyone else has any information regarding
PKP and if they plan to do anything about RSA licensing.  It seems to me that
they are just about to lose any control over RSA if pgp were to become
widespread (god forbid).  I think they'd do better if they came out with some
sort of reasonable licensing agreement.

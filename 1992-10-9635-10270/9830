I am reposting this article because in the previous post the lines 
were greater than 72 characters. I've already received a response to 
this article and if anybody is interested feel free to e-mail me.
I apologize for the inconvenience.

I just got a VCR Plus device (@Fry's in LA for $28.88) and think it's
the greatest thing since sliced bread.  No, I am not VCR illiterate.
It's just that I have an old VCR which does not have on-screen
programming. 

I am new to this newsgroup and I have been trying to figure out how 
the VCR Plus codes are derived? 

My inquiry is purely academic. I don't intend to invent my own device.
I've tried to determine if there is a consistent pattern, but have
found none.I suspect there is some sort of encryption. I have also 
noticed that prime time shows on channels 2-13 have codes with the 
fewest digits.

I was told by a helpful netter in rec.puzzles that this newsgroup has
been down this line of inquiry before.

If this query has already been answerd in a FAQ, let me know where I
can get it or e-mail it to me. If this is the wrong group for this I
apologize and point me in the right direction.

Thanx

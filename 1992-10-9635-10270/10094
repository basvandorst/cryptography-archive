1. The Fourth Amendment, as you point out, does provide that the
   Government can search my property and papers.  But it certainly
   doesn't say that I have to assist in deciphering them, if they
   happen to be enciphered.  The Fourth Amendment says nothing about
   the Government's right to information.

2. The Tenth Amendment (I believe), to deal with ambiguous cases in
   the Constitution and the law, specifically reserves to the people
   all rights not otherwise mentioned.  Therefore, any argument of the
   form, "The Constitution doesn't say that the Government can't do
   <X>, therefore it is allowed to do <X>," is automatically ruled
   out.  The Government CAN'T do <X> unless it says somewhere that it
   can.

3. Before there was an income tax, I think you would have had to search
   a long time to find a judge to say that the Government DID have the
   right to know all about your sources of income.

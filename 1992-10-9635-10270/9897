I am looking for a C programmer who is willing to implement FEAL and N-Hash.
FEAL is a block algorithm from Japan; N-Hash is a one-way hash function from
the same place.  Eli Biham and Adi Shamir made mincemeat out of them with
differential cryptanalysis, but they still have some interest.

Anyway, I have paper copies of C source code that claims to implement the
algorithms (a few pages; not very long).  I am looking for someone who is
willing to get them working, and then let me publish the source code in my
book.

This looks like a pretty simple operation for an experienced C programmer.
Any takers?

Bruce

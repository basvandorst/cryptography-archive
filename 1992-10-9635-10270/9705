I'll be at this month's National Computer Security Conference
in Baltimore, Maryland. I expect that a number of the readers
of this feed and users of PGP will be there. 

This seems to me to be an opportunity to exchange public keys,
and maybe even get them signed. Is anyone else interested in
meeting sometime during the conference for this purpose?

This would at least be slightly more secure than trusting a
posted public key. Of course, whether you believe that it
really is me is a different story. I'm presenting a paper that
I wrote with a co-author that I've never met. So I can't know
that even he is who he claims - or that I am who I claim :-)

Please Email or reply via post. Even if we simply meet to talk
about PGP over a beer, it could be worthwhile.

Pat

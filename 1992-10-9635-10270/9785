Here's my list of books, etc., for beginners.  This list is heavy on
the cryptanalysis side, rather than the cryptography side, on purpose.
It is a rule of thumb that no one should attempt to design a
cryptosystem without having practiced breaking them.

	David Kahn, The Codebreakers, Macmillan, 1967
		(definitive history of cryptology up to WW-II)

	Gordon Welchman, The Hut Six Story, McGraw-Hill, 1982
		(excellent description of his WW-II crypto work
		 (breaking the German Enigma); discussion of modern
		 cryptological implications)

	H. F. Gaines, Cryptanalysis, Dover, 1956 (originally 1939)
		(pre-WW-II cryptanalysis)

	Abraham Sinkov, Elementary Cryptanalysis, Math. Assoc. of Amer., 1966
		(pre-WW-II cryptanalysis; more mathematical than Gaines)

	D Denning, Cryptography and Data Security, Addison-Wesley, 1983
		(mostly modern systems; more cryptography than
		 cryptanalysis; protocols; ...)

	Andrew Hodges, Alan Turing: The Enigma, Burnett Books Ltd., 1983
		(biography of Turing; some coverage of his crypto work
		 in WW-II)

	The entire list of publications from the Aegean Park Press
		P.O. Box 2837, Laguna Hills, CA 92654-0837
		(mostly pre-WW-II reprints; very expensive; good sources)

	Various volumes from Artech House, 610 Washington St., Dedham MA
	02026; including:

		Deavours & Hruh, Machine Cryptography and Modern Cryptanalysis
        	        (operation and breaking of cipher machines through
			 about 1955).

		Deavours, et al., CRYPTOLOGY Yesterday, Today, and Tomorrow
			(Cryptologia reprints -- 1st volume)

		Deavours, et al., CRYPTOLOGY: Machines, History & Methods
			(Cryptologia reprints -- 2nd volume)

	Cryptologia:  a cryptology journal, quarterly since Jan 1977.
		Cryptologia
		Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology
		Terre Haute Indiana  47803

	Journal of the International Association for Cryptologic Research
		(quarterly since 1988).

	The RSA paper: The Comm. of the ACM, Feb 1978, p. 120

	Claude Shannon's 2 1940's papers in the Bell System Tech Journal.

	Herbert O. Yardley, The American Black Chamber, Bobbs-Merrill, 1931
		(1st hand history -- WW-I era)

	Edwin Layton, "And I Was There", William Morrow & Co., 1985
		(1st hand history -- WW-II era)

	W. Kozaczuk, Enigma, University Publications of America, 1984

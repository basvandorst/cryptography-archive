The leading advocate of electronic freedom appears to be the
Electronic Frontiers Foundation, or EFF. There are two NetNews groups,
comp.org.eff.news and comp.org.eff.talk, which discuss various issues.
See them for details. BTW, I posted a brief article in
comp.org.eff.talk alerting them to this issue and referring to this
thread in sci.crypt.

The ACLU also has some folks working in this area.

The conference "Computers, Freedom, and Privacy" is devoted to these
issues. Another one is coming up in the San Francisco area in a few
months.

By the way, Prof. Dorothy Denning and many other leading computer
security experts were at the 1st CFP, as well as the second. This
attendance, and even apparent sympathy to electronic freedom, does not
such they won't cook up schemes like the one I cited. Bruce Sterling's
new book, "The Hacker Crackdown," describes Denning and her
interactions with Phiber Optik and other well-known hackers.

Without very clear ideas of how the privacy of communications is a
sacrosanct right, expect to see more well-meaning attempts by folks
like Dorothy Denning to place "reasonable" limits on the privacy we
have.

I suspect a "hard line" group like the National Rifle Association is
needed to stop the "death by a thousand cuts" of well-intentioned gun
control legislation, and I suspect the same is true of crypto tools
and privacy. The only difference is that we are unorganized, have no
clout, and don't have millions of members lobbying for our continued
rights.

Maybe we need bumper stickers: "They'll get my crypto tools when they
pry my cold, dead fingers off my keyboard."

Ultimately, though, the technology will be too hard to control. But
the next 20 years could be dicey.

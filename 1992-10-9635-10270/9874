Can anyone send me the PRECISE algorithm used to build a UNIX
password for the password file?  Source code for it would be
even nicer.  The reason I need it is I am trying to get a script
working that will add many users out of a list of names (we are
a university and have to add around a hundred users all at once at
the beginning of each semester).  It works fine except for setting
the initial password.  Since passwd will only work interactively,
we are forced to do "unclean" things with /dev/tty.  If I could
just build the encrypted string myself and insert it into the
line I added to the password file, my life would be a LOT easier.

Note:  A straight reply may not work; we are having trouble getting
	our From: line correct!  Sorry!

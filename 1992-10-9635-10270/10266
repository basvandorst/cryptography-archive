William Unruh * For those  of us outside the  USofA these analogies make
                us wonder whether such registration is not a good thing.
                If crypt really is like guns,  whose only use is to kill
                lots of innocent people it seems, then maybe
                                 = = =

    A  common  mis-conception...  Alchohol  related  deaths  claim  more
    innocent people  perhaps we should outlaw  it? I think that  one was
    tried. (and failed).

William Unruh * stronger if you limited yourself  to the uses and abuses
                of cryptography and didn't  engage in the silly American
                penchant for seeing yourselves oa as lone cowboys out to
                right wrongs no matter how many people get killed in the
                crossfire.
                                 = = =

    I tend to agree with you here.. We should of let Saddam take Kuwait,
    Hitler take  Europe.. Anyone else  you want to  add to this  list of
    where Americans were wrongfully involved in international affairs?

William Unruh * that cryptography and guns have any similarity at all. I
                see no  problem with the  government trying to  regulate
                our lives for  the common good (and yes  that is hard to
                discerne at times and that is why we have open political
                processes  so   the  arguements  can   be  advanced  and
                experiments tried and thrown out if they don't work)
                                 = = =

   I  see the  sarcasm... perhaps  you  will  in my  above replies.  The
   problem  is  that  once  a  bad  law  is  passed it is almost *never*
   repealed.  I  don't  beleive  that  the  Federal  Government  has any
   business telling me what I can and  cannot do.. In my opinion that is
   not what it was originally set up for.

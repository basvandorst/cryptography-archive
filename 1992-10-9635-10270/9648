How about a cryptosystem that used the teachings of various
religious figures in the Bible as its key?As a spy, I would write
a passionate letter detailing my sins and moral turpitude to my spy partner, 
and he/she would assign a "long beep" to the aspects of my sins that were
in accordance with the bible, and  a "short beep" to those that weren't.  T
output would be a Morse-code of biblical proportions! By using the bible as t
key, we could have uncrackable, undetectable, and public key encryption.
Any comments?

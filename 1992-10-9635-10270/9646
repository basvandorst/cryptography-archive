NOTE: Yes, you may have noticed I'm posting a lot about breaking DES/UNIX
encryption.  I am not a hacker, I'm merely trying to understand the way it
works and learn exactly how secure this algorithm really is.  I gave up hacking
a long time ago. (:

Let's say someone retreives the DES source code, which is easy enough.  Why
WOULDN'T they be able to take every single mathematical operation, reverse each
one, and then have a "decrypt()"?  I know it's not that simple, but how has DES
made it so even a good mathematician can't just reverse all the operations?

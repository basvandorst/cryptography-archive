A primary concern in cryptography is to avoid underestimating future
computational capabilities.  The security of a system against future attack
depends on both improvements in cryptanalytic algorithms and on improvements
in computing hardware.  Predicting improvements in cryptanalytic algorithms
is often quite difficult but the problem of forecasting future advances in hardware
is more tractable, at least if we assume that computers continue to be made from
atoms.  In this case it is possible to make at least some estimates of future
computing capability.

I strongly recommend Drexler's new technical book as the best summary of the
fundamental issues involved in building complex structures (such as computers)
from atoms.  Anyone trying to estimate the capabilities of future computing
hardware should have a copy.

The ability to inexpensively fabricate large structures with atomic precision
has implications for other areas, as well.

"Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation"
by K. Eric Drexler, published by John Wiley & Sons, 1992 ($24.95),
is now available.  It can be ordered directly from Wiley by
calling (800) 225-5945 ext 2497.  They take major credit cards.


"With this book, Drexler has established the field of molecular
nanotechnology.  The detailed analyses show quantum chemists and
synthetic chemists how to build upon their knowledge of bonds
and molecules to develop the manufacturing systems of nanotechnology,
and show physicists and engineers how to scale down their concepts
of macroscopic systems to the level of molecules."
    William A. Goddard III, Professor of Chemistry and Applied Physics,
    Director, Materials and Molecular Simulation Center,
    California Institute of Technology


"Devices enormously smaller than before will remodel engineering,
chemistry, medicine, and computer technology.  How can we understand
machines that are so small?  NANOSYSTEMS covers it all:  power and
strength, friction and wear, thermal noise and quantum uncertainty.
This is THE book for starting the next century of engineering."
    Marvin Minsky, Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science,
    Toshiba Professor of Media Arts and Sciences,
    Massachusetts Institute of Technology


"Manufactured products are made from atoms, and their properties depend
on how those atoms are arranged.  This volume summarizes 15 years of
research in molecular manufacturing, the use of nanoscale mechanical
systems to guide the placement of reactive molecules, building complex
structures with atom-by-atom control.  This degree of control is a
natural goal for technology:  Microtechnology strives to build smaller
devices; materials science strives to make more useful solids; chemistry
strives to synthesize more complex molecules; manufacturing strives
to make better products.  Each of these fields requires precise,
molecular control of complex structures to reach its natural limit,
a goal that has been termed molecular nanotechnology."

"It has become clear that this degree of control can be achieved.  The
present volume assembles the conceptual and analytical tools needed
to understand molecular machinery and manufacturing, presents an
analysis of their core capabilities and explores how present laboratory
techniques can be extended, stage by stage, to implement molecular
manufacturing systems."

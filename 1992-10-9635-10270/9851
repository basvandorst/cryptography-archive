Any encryption scheme that has a fixed block length *must* do this. Think
of a series of encryptions:
	x_1 -> x_2 -> x_3 -> ... -> x_k -> ... -> x_n -> ...
If 'n' is greater than the possible number of messages that can be encoded
in the fixed length block, there must be some blocks in the chain that
are the same (pigeonhole principle). Let x_k and x_n be the same blocks.
Then by encrypting x_k (n-k)-times yields x_k.

(n-k) might be quite large, though. ;-)

ps. I'm not sure, but it would seem that this applies to every
    block x_n.....?

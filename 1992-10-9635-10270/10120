About registering keys with a "trustee"...
 
>(Gawd, I feel like Cassandra here. Is anyone listening?)

Yes, we are.  I'm sure key registration will prove just as
effective as drug control...HA!

And you know what?  This will be another market force applied
by the government which will cause crypto systems to be so
profitable that protection of market share by violent means
will become reasonable, just as drugs, just as drugs.

The _violence_ in this country will only end when it is no
longer _profitable_ to commit violence.  This requires either
Draconian law enforcement which will hurt every citizen, or
elimination of government bans which support the profitability
of the industry.

An on the topic of women's issues, it is not unthinkable to
imagine that in the future abortion will only be able to be
carried out by passing encrypted messages between doctor and
patient to arrange a meeting place.

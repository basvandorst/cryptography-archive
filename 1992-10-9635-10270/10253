But is it patented?  Are you allowed to use it in USA without
permission from the patent holder?  I've heard some rumors about a
patent secrecy order being placed on some parts due to national
security reasons, the process of jury nullification comes to mind.

I heard the material used in the original version is illegal in USA
now.  I wonder if this applies also to all computers carrying copies
(via the analogues act).  Anyway, if I were a cop in USA, I'd go to
the place where they keep the original copy and forfeit it to my local
police precinct - would build some nice office rooms there.  Perhaps I
could also get some computers from AT&T if the analogues act applies.

	I am a senior Electrical Engineering major at the University of
	 Delaware, and am currently in need of some information.  I am
	 currently enrolled in a course entitled "Ethics in the Engineering 
	 Profession", and need information related to encryption theory
	 and technology and their relation to National Security, as in cases
	 where the act of research was deemed sensitive and not for the
	 public.  Of especial interest for the class would be specific cases
	 that we could reference.  Since this is not a newsgroup that I read,
	 if you could reply by mail, my partners and I would greatly appreciate
	 it.

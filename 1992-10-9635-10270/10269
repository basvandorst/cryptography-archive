Aargh!  Once again you are missing a crucial distinction.  You and I are
both people.  Obviously, if we wish to live together in peace, we will
each have to forego our putative "Right of Revenge," or else our children
will be left with an ugly mess to clean up.

However, when our rights conflict with Government's rights, the Bill of
Rights says WE WIN!

There is no "police power" in the Constitution.  Quite the contrary!  The
Fourth Amendment is all about *restraint* of police power!

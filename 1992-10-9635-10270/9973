I don't recall seeing my following question in the FAQs that I got, so hopefully
someone can give be some brief info on it. My question is: What type of
encryption is used on the passwd file on a regular UNIX system (i'm not familiar
with the different versions), and does it have any relation to the encryption
method used in 386BSD?

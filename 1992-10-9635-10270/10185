	A more interesting twist to this problem is:

	How do you prove in court that the chunk of data is a message/evidence
	of illegal activity, without either a) expecting a jury will just
	take your word for it, or b) demonstrating that you can break the
	encryption?

	It'd be worth one of us going to jail for a few months to know
for sure that the government could in fact break cryptosystem XX for any
nontrivial cryptosystem XX.

	It is possibly this dilemma that drives the current "make it all
illegal" attitude. If it's all illegal, you don't have to reveal your
capabilities at code-breaking.

	"Hmmmm... a DAT full of `white noise' - son, we're sending you
up on possession of random bits. The war on `white noise' continues!"

	When white noise is illegal, only criminals and television sets
will have white noise. ;)

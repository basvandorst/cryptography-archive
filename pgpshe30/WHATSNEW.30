PGPShell 3.0
============

What isn't new?  PGPShell version 3.0 is a complete from-the-ground-up
rewrite of the successful version 2.2.  Why change anything is version
2.2 was so popular?  Because while version 2.2 was good, I envisioned
something better, and got it with version 3.0.

  o  New Key Management Screen that organizes the PGP key view
     commands into one concise display.  Keys on your key ring
     are better handled as well, with 'report' formatting of
     KeyView, Fingerprint, E-mail address and all signator's 
     attached to the key.  Added the capability of preparing an
     encrypted e-mail from within the Key Management Screen.

  o  Improved, comprehensive, pop-up context-sensitive help
     screens throughout PGPShell by pressing F1.

  o  Streamlined main menu and commands intuitively takes the
     user to the next proper step in the PGP encryption/decryption
     process.  

  o  Command-line decryption process for signature checking and
     immediate decryption of PGP-encrypted files.

  o  The addition of the clear signing option in lieu of 
     PGP encryption when preparing text for recipients.

  o  The addition of a built-in text editor for message
     preparation.

  o  Improved, speedier, file viewer for any size DOS file.
 

All programs have a couple of bugs hanging around...  Don't keep 'em 
to yourself!  Let me know about them so that I can PGPShell even
better than ever.  Don't assume someone else already wrote about it,
because odds are they didn't.  You can e-mail me at:

   *** IMPORTANT NOTES!!! ***
*******************************

1. The installer will ensure proper functioning especially during decrypt operations,
by copying all PIF files in WinPGP® to your Windows directory.  Decrypt will
cause a full-screen vs. Windowed screen if decryption occurs outside
the WinPGP home directory.

2. WinPGP® contains none of the PGP® executables and incorporates none
of the PGP® source code in any way or form.  This program simply 
provides the user with a convenient Windows GUI interface.

3. Users of WinPGP® must accept this disclaimer of warranty: 

"WinPGP® is supplied as is.  The author disclaims all warranties, expressed or implied, 
including, without limitation, the warranties of merchantability and of fitness for any purpose.
The author assumes no liability for damages, direct or consequential, which may result from the 
use of WinPGP®."

4. WinPGP® is a "shareware program" and is provided at no charge to the user for evaluation.
Feel free to share it with your friends, but please do not give it away altered or as part of 
another system.  The essence of "user-supported" software is to provide personal computer users 
with quality software without high prices, and yet to provide incentive for programmers to 
continue to develop new products.  If you find this program useful and find that you are using 
WinPGP® and continue to use WinPGP® after a reasonable 30 day trial period, you must make a 
registration payment of $29 US by check or money order to Christopher W. Geib, or if you register
via Compuserve, the registration cost is $34.50 US.  The $29 US registration fee will license 
one copy for use on any one computer at any one time.  You must treat this software just like 
a book.  An example is that this software may be used by any number of people and may be freely 
moved from one computer location to another, so long as there is no possibility of it being used 
at one location while it's being used at another.  Just as a book cannot be read by two different
persons at the same time.  Commercial users of WinPGP® must register and pay for their copies of 
WinPGP® within 30 days of first use or their license is withdrawn.  Site-License arrangements 
may be made by contacting Christopher W. Geib.

5. Anyone distributing WinPGP® for any kind of remuneration must first contact 
Christopher W. Geib at the address below for authorization.  This authorization will be 
automatically granted to distributors recognized by the Association of Shareware Professionals 
(ASP) as adhering to its guidelines for shareware distributors, and such distributors may begin 
offering WinPGP® immediately (However Christopher W. Geib must still be advised so that the 
distributor can be kept up-to-date with the latest version of WinPGP®).

6. You are encouraged to pass a copy of WinPGP® along to your friends for evaluation.  
Please encourage them to register their copy if they find that they can use it.  All registered 
users will receive a copy of the latest version of the WinPGP® system.

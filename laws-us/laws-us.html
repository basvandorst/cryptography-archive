<H2>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</H2>
<P>This document analyzes issues pertaining to the use and regulation of
encryption technology. Section 1 of this document analyzes constitutional issues
pertaining to encryption technology. The first issue deals with the freedom of
speech and the First Amendment and addresses whether encrypted speech is
protected speech, whether requiring encryption key disclosure to the government
violates a user's freedom of speech, whether a government's prohibition against
use of certain cryptographic technologies infringes upon freedom of speech, and
whether governmental control of encryption technology through export and import
laws infringes an individual's freedom of speech. Next, the right to privacy and
the First Amendment is analyzed, addressing whether government prohibition
against use of certain cryptographic technologies infringes an individual's
right to privacy and whether a key escrow system that allows access to encrypted
speech infringes right to privacy.</P>
<P>The analysis of the Fourth Amendment deals with the issue of illegal search
and seizure of stored and voice communications. Pertaining to stored
communications, this section addresses whether the government can seize
encrypted electronic/computer stored documents without prior notification to
owner, and whether requiring disclosure of an encryption key to the government
in advance of probable cause to seize communications is violative of the Fourth
Amendment. With respect to voice and data transmission, the issues of whether,
in a situation where one or both users of the proposed key escrow system are
located outside the borders of the United States, a warrant requirement exists
to seize voice or data communications, whether the government can seize
encrypted electronic/computer communications without prior notification to
owner, and whether requiring disclosure of an encryption key to the government
in advance of probable cause to seize voice and data communications is violative
of the Fourth Amendment.</P>
<P>Analysis of the Fifth Amendment addresses the key escrow system and the
privilege against compelled self-incrimination. The key issue is whether a key
escrow system that may involuntarily secure from the user the &quot;key&quot; to
decipher the user's encrypted messages violates the Fifth Amendment's privilege
against self-incrimination.</P>
<P>Section 2 of this document analyzes the current state of the law pertaining
to the statutes and rules regulating the domestic use, exportation, and
importation of encryption technology. With respect to the control of the export
of encryption technology, an overview of the Arms Export Control Act, the Export
Administration Act, and the Invention Secrecy Act is given, and their relation
to encryption technology is summarized. For import controls, an overview of
controls of permanent and temporary imports by the State Department, the
Treasury Department, and the Federal Communications Commission is given, and the
impact on the importation of encryption technology is summarized.</P>

<H1>1.1.1.2  State of the law</H1>
<P>The First Amendment provides that &quot;Congress shall make no law . . .
abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press, or the right of people
peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of
grievance.&quot;&lt;1&gt; Currently, it appears that the Supreme Court is
advancing toward a hierarchical view of the First Amendment, which assigns
different levels of constitutional protection to different kinds of expression.
The Court considers &quot;protected speech&quot; speech that the First Amendment
protects against prior restraints and punishment after the fact.&lt;2&gt;
Because all speech is not protected to the same degree, protected speech falls
into two categories, &quot;fully protected speech&quot; and &quot;middle-tier
speech.&quot; Fully protected speech is speech protected to the limits of the
First Amendment's scope as defined by the Supreme Court.&lt;3&gt; The Court has
stated that speech of &quot;literary, political, or scientific value&quot; is
more likely to be protected.&lt;4&gt; In <I>Ohralik v. Ohio State Bar
Association</I>, the Court held that commercial speech deserves only a &quot;limited
measure of protection, commensurate with its subordinate position in the scale
of First Amendment values.&quot;&lt;5&gt; The distinction between fully
protected speech and middle-tier speech (i.e., commercial speech) appears when
the government attempts to suppress speech content.&lt;6&gt; If the government
attempts to control communicative speech in order to suppress a viewpoint or
because it fears what the message will prompt or enable the audience to do, the
government must demonstrate a &quot;compelling&quot; interest in the case of
fully protected speech&lt;7&gt; and &quot;substantial&quot; interest for
middle-tier speech.&lt;8&gt; Alternatively, if the government tries to regulate
only the noncommunicative impact of protected speech, regulation is allowed so
long as it does not unreasonably interfere with the speaker's communication of
their message to the targeted audience or leaves other alternative means for
communication.&lt;9&gt; In the case of both tiers of speech, the regulatory
methods must precisely serve the asserted governmental interest, and they must
be the least restrictive of all means available to the government.&lt;10&gt;</P>
<P>The Supreme Court has not decided whether the use of cryptography, encrypted
speech specifically or scientific speech is protected under the First Amendment.&lt;11&gt;
The Court in <I>Virginia Pharmacy</I> held that commercial speech is not
subject to complete suppression by the state, and it considered three major
interests that lie at the heart of the freedom of speech guarantee: (1) the
individual interests of the giver and receiver, (2) societal interest in the
free flow of information, and (3) societal interest in enlightened decision
making.&lt;12&gt; Communication of scientific and technological information
serves the first interest of individual self-expression because scientific
expression is largely an individualistic and creative process.&lt;13&gt; These
interests are intellectual in nature, and thus, unlike commercial advertising,
they are fully consistent with the general views of free expression and
self-realization.&lt;14&gt; The second interest is served because the free flow
of scientific information allows the scientist to draw on the work and
experimentation of colleagues, which guards against scientific error, therefore
promoting discovery of scientific truth and fostering technological advancement.&lt;15&gt;
Finally, scientific expression is essential to informed public decision making
for a wide range of the major policy issues, from environmental concerns to
foreign policy.&lt;16&gt; Accordingly, the Supreme Court could very likely
afford scientific speech full protection under the First Amendment.&lt;17&gt;
</P>
<P><B>Commercial speech. </B>The Court defines &quot;commercial speech&quot;
as that proposing a commercial transaction,&lt;18&gt; rather than using an
earlier and broader definition of commercial speech &quot;related solely to the
economic interests of the speaker and its audience.&quot;&lt;19&gt; However,
most scientific speech is concerned with the advancement of knowledge, which
serves an interest well beyond narrow economic concerns and proposes more than
just a commercial transaction. Thus, the Court would likely classify scientific
speech as noncommercial.&lt;20&gt; The sole context in which commercial speech
cases have been heard before the Supreme Court has dealt with advertising, which
has motivated the Justice Department to conclude that technical data would not
be commercial speech merely because these data were available for a fee.&lt;21&gt;
Even though private communication of proprietary technological information often
serves commercial purposes, commercial value is usually the reason for
maintaining its proprietary status. </P>
<P>All noncommercial speech, however, is not entitled to full First Amendment
protection. The Court has clearly stated that &quot;matters of public concern
[are] at the heart of the [F]irst [A]mendment's protection.&quot;&lt;22&gt;
Beyond this area, the Court has tried to balance the interests of the state in
regulating societal evils against interest in public communications. Therefore,
if scientific speech speaks to matters of public concern, it should receive full
protection. However, if such speech is not concerned with public affairs and is
regulated by export laws, the Court would presumably balance national security
interests against the First Amendment.&lt;23&gt;</P>
<P><B>Speech incidental to regulated conduct. </B>Speech that is incidental to
regulated conduct may receive no First Amendment protection at all. Currently,
the government does control exports of particular articles; therefore, it can
control speech to the extent necessary to make control of the articles
effective.&lt;24&gt; In <I>Ohralik v. Ohio</I>, the Supreme Court concluded
that it has never been deemed an &quot;abridgement of freedom of speech or press
to make a course of conduct illegal merely because the conduct was in part
initiated, evidenced, or carried out by means of language, either spoken,
written, or printed.&quot;&lt;25&gt; The <I>Ohralik</I> court cited antitrust,
securities regulations, and labor relations as areas of governmental-regulated
conduct despite a large component of written or spoken speech.&lt;26&gt; The
relation between speech and properly regulated conduct was the rationale behind
the Court's decision in <I>United States v. Edler</I>.&lt;27&gt; In this case,
the defendant was convicted of exporting technical data which outlined a process
for making missile cases without a license under the U.S. Munitions List. The
Court held that the federal government definitely possesses the authority to
regulate the international arms traffic, and, as a necessary incident to that
authority to control arms export, the President has authority to control the
flow of information concerning the production and use of arms.&lt;28&gt; The
<I>Edler</I> court held that the U.S. Munitions List was not overbroad, by
restricting the definition of &quot;technical data&quot; to include data that
are &quot;significantly and directly related&quot; to specific articles on the
Munitions List.&lt;29&gt; While restricting the definition of technical data,
the Court cited First Amendment concerns if the definition were to be broader.&lt;30&gt;
The Justice Department after reviewing <I>Edler</I> applied the same rationale
to the Export Administration Regulations (EARs) and concluded that the far
greater range of information and technology sought to be regulated by the EARs
made it unlikely that these regulations could meet the restraints imposed by
<I>Edler</I>: &quot;It is apparent that the [EARs] apply a prior restraint in
the form of a licensing requirement, to a wide variety of protected speech.&quot;&lt;31&gt;
</P>
<P><B>Prior Restraints. </B>The doctrine of prior restraint applies to fully
protected speech. A prior restraint attempts to prevent an act of communication
from occurring.&lt;32&gt; Any system of prior restraints is adjudicated by the
Supreme Court, bearing a heavy burden of showing justification for the
imposition of such a restraint.&lt;33&gt; Prior restraints are allowed when
subsequent punishment cannot protect an extremely important governmental
interest.&lt;34&gt; A system of prior restraint of expression comes in two
forms: administrative licensing schemes and judicially imposed injunctions. In
the former category is a group of cases in which the Court has rejected
licensing schemes requiring executive approval prior to use of public facilities
for political or religious purposes, display of motion pictures, distribution of
pamphlets, and public parades and demonstrations.&lt;35&gt;</P>
<P>Licensing schemes, such as the Arms Export Control Act and the Export
Administration Act, must meet strict standards to guide the licensing
authorities so that constitutional standards can be met, otherwise such schemes
may prohibit constitutionally protected speech. Thus, licensing schemes tend to
restrain speech that is protected but that is close to the definition of
unprotected speech.&lt;36&gt; </P>
<P>The leading case which involves prior restraint of judicial injunctions is
<I>Near v. Minnesota ex rel. Olson</I>, in which the defendant had published a
series of articles critical of several public officials in violation of a
Minneapolis statute that granted judicial abatement of any newspaper deemed &quot;malicious,
scandalous, and defamatory.&quot;&lt;37&gt; The district court granted an
injunction sought by the officials to shut the newspaper down. The Supreme Court
reversed, concluding that such a statute was the &quot;essence of censorship.&quot;&lt;38&gt;
<I>Near</I> established the doctrine of judicial injunctions as a form of prior
restraint.&lt;39&gt;</P>
<P>There are important distinctions between prior restraint through
administrative licensing and through judicial order. In licensing schemes, an
administrative official often acting ex parte and frequently without clear
standards, and almost always without training to distinguish what is and is not
protected, can quickly and easily prohibit speech, publication, or
demonstration.&lt;40&gt; The applicant has the burden to seek judicial review.
In contrast, when the government seeks to prohibit speech through judicial
injunction, it carries the heavy burden. The government must sue in open court
and persuade an impartial and trained judge to issue such an order. With
administrative licensing, the risk that protected speech will actually be
prevented is great; with injunction, the risk is slight. Therefore, the
important differences between them can be blurred when both are simply
referenced as prior restraint.&lt;41&gt; </P>
<P><B>National Security Exception</B>. Executive Order 12356 defines national
security as the &quot;national defense or foreign relations of the United
States.&quot;&lt;42&gt; The Constitution Preamble gives &quot;national defense
equal status with the blessings of liberty.&quot;&lt;43&gt; The Supreme Court in
<I>Haig v. Agee</I> recognized that national security is the most important
interest that could be threatened by uncontrolled dissemination of speech.&lt;44&gt;
Nevertheless, in <I>New York Times Co. v. United States</I>, Justice Harlan in
dissent stated that constitutional considerations forbid a &quot;complete
abandonment of judicial control&quot; of the President's authority to determine
issues that threaten national security.&lt;45&gt; </P>
<P>Assuming scientific information is protected speech, it would still be
necessary to determine the nature of that speech whose dissemination could pose
either a &quot;compelling&quot; or &quot;substantial&quot; threat to national
security.&lt;46&gt; In the case of fully protected speech, a &quot;compelling&quot;
threat to national security is a danger that poses an immediate,&lt;47&gt;
certain,&lt;48&gt; and exceptional&lt;49&gt; threat. For instance, fully
protected scientific information is subject to regulation if it conveys a
message that would allow a potential or actual enemy to develop a significant
weapon or countermeasure to a U.S. weapon within a period too short for the
United States to take corrective measures.&lt;50&gt; For example, an immediate
threat would entail a short time frame from receipt of an article by a foreign
power to its actual application, as measured on an appropriate time scale of
technological development.&lt;51&gt; A certain threat is created if the
information poses a threat with direct military application or related
production applicability.&lt;52&gt; Scientific information poses an exceptional
threat when it would give the enemy an &quot;identifiable military advantage
over the United States in military terms.&quot;&lt;53&gt;</P>
<P>In determining whether scientific information poses a substantial threat,
the above three criteria are applicable.&lt;54&gt; If the possible time of
application is remote as measured on an appropriate time scale of technological
development, the threat to national security is too speculative to justify
controls.&lt;55&gt; Accordingly, if the information has uncertain military or
related application, again the threat may be too speculative.&lt;56&gt; If the
United States is not the exclusive source, attempts to control the information
would seem to serve no &quot;rational purpose.&quot;&lt;57&gt; </P>
<P>In national security cases, many courts and commentators have often
suggested that there is an exception to the prior restraint doctrine.&lt;58&gt;
These cases suggest that if there is such an exception, it allows the government
only to seek an injunction in appropriate situations, not the use of an
administrative licensing procedure.&lt;59&gt;</P>
<P>The judicial recognition of the national security exception stems from <I>Near</I>,&lt;60&gt;
in which the Court stated that although the defendant's conduct would not
justify an injunction, there might be circumstances involving national security
that would provide justification for one. The Court in <I>Near</I> applied a &quot;clear
and present danger&quot; test,&lt;61&gt; which has evolved into a more
speech-protective test articulated in <I>Brandenburg v. Ohio</I>.&lt;62&gt; The
national security exception was implicitly affirmed when the government sought
to enjoin the Pentagon Papers in <I>New York Times, Inc. v. United States</I>,
when the district court denied the government's motion for an injunction.
However, the Second Circuit Court issued a stay and remanded, relying on the
exception. The Supreme Court finally reversed and held that the government did
not carry its burden. In concurrence, Justice Stewart argued that an injunction
would be improper because the publication would not &quot;surely result in
direct, immediate, and irreparable damage to our nation or its people.&quot;&lt;63&gt;
</P>
<P>These decisions might suggest that the government could not carry its burden
unless the information involved was classified and would have a difficult case
to make even if classified.&lt;64&gt; The Pentagon Papers were classified, and
the examples suggested in <I>Near</I>&#151;&quot;the sailing dates of
transports or the location of troops&#151;might also be expected to be
classified.&quot;&lt;65&gt; These cases reveal that there is a narrow national
security exception to the prior restraint doctrine but that it is limited to
cases involving classified information. Even then the government has the burden
to show in seeking an injunction that release of the information would cause
immediate and serious damage to the national interest.&lt;66&gt;</P>
<H1>1.1.1.3  General issues addressed</H1>
<P><B>First general issue.</B> In the first general issue&#151;Is encrypted
speech protected speech under the First Amendment?&#151;the Supreme Court has
not decided whether the use of cryptography, encrypted speech specifically or
scientific speech is protected under the First Amendment.&lt;67&gt; The Court in
<I>Virginia Pharmacy</I> considered three major interests that lie at the heart
of the freedom of speech guarantee. In an analysis of these interests, the
Supreme Court could very likely afford these forms of speech full protection
under the First Amendment.&lt;68&gt; However, encrypted speech and the use of
cryptography are not essential to public debate on major issues of the day.
Indeed, it could be argued that the use of encrypted speech inhibits full and
free debate.</P>
<P>Several commentaries have explored First Amendment protection in the
preservation of the &quot;electronic forum, which impacts the use of
cryptographic technology.&quot;&lt;69&gt; The electronic forum encompasses the
electronic media (i.e., radio, television, cable satellite, bulletin boards,
voicemail, facsimile), and information systems (computer or electronic hardware,
software, human users, data).&lt;70&gt; The direction of recent First Amendment
jurisprudence has displayed that the nature of the forum in which expression
occurs tends to define the scope of protection for that forum.&lt;71&gt;
Therefore, the nature of the electronic forum will become the main issue of an
inquiry into the First Amendment rights for electronic or computer-based
expression. As forms of communication proliferate, and as problems that are
unique to a particular technology or format are discovered, further
fragmentation of the First Amendment doctrine will occur.&lt;72&gt; While a few
general principles may still apply to all media, differences in treatment among
media can be expected to grow.&lt;73&gt;</P>
<P>Increasingly more apparent are the difficulties in enforcing restrictions on
communication in an electronic forum.&lt;74&gt; It is anticipated that cases
will take into account the &quot;effective limits of the law,&quot; and
decisions will &quot;implicitly reflect assumptions about media capabilities for
accessing, processing, or sending information.&quot;&lt;75&gt; The production of
information, processing of information, and transmission or publication of
information are the most vulnerable areas in the communication environment.&lt;76&gt;</P>
<P>An area significant to cryptographic technology is the transmission of
information. One of the most &quot;obvious victim[s]&quot; of the qualities of
the new media will be the prior restraint doctrine, which is a means of
government control that is &quot;doomed to a condition of almost complete
nonviability.&quot;&lt;77&gt; The two forms of prior restraints, licensing
schemes and injunctions, are even more vulnerable as copying and distribution
capabilities are enhanced between parties inside and outside the U.S. borders.&lt;78&gt;
As the flow of information accelerates, it is appropriate to be mindful of a
comment by a former director of the U.S. Information Agency, who stated that &quot;the
only way to censor an electronic network moving 648 million bits per second is
to pull the plug.&quot;&lt;79&gt; While the prior restraint doctrine may be a
potential casualty, the ability of punishment after the fact will also suffer. A
concern definitely arises in international communications where punishment of
sources located outside the U.S. borders is generally not possible.&lt;80&gt;</P>
<P><B>Second general issue.</B> In the second general issue&#151;Does
requiring encryption key disclosure to the government in a particular technology
violate the user's right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment?&#151;requiring
disclosure of a cryptographic key, while using a government algorithm, regulates
only the noncommunicative impact form of speech. Regulation of the
noncommunicative impact of protected speech is allowed as long as it does not
unreasonably interfere with the speaker's communication of his or her message to
the targeted audience or as long as it leaves other alternative means for
communication.&lt;81&gt; The regulatory schemes must precisely serve the
asserted governmental interest and must be the least restrictive of all means
available to the government.&lt;82&gt; </P>
<P>Thus, in a key escrow system, as long as the asserted governmental interest
is served, the requirement of the disclosure of the cryptographic keys might be
permissible. A growing governmental interest within the law enforcement
community is the future widespread use of commercial cryptographic technology in
criminal activity and the subsequent negative implications that creates in the
electronic surveillance area. Also, the government must establish that the key
escrow system is the least restrictive means to protect its asserted interest.
Therefore, other schemes that could possibly protect the asserted governmental
interest must be explored.&lt;83&gt; </P>
<P>However, given the recently available information on the procedures
governing key escrow technology, concerns arise on whether the government is
requiring disclosure of an encrypted key prior to sufficient probable cause. On
each cryptographic device, the government key escrow agents will possess a
unique &quot;identification number&quot; and &quot;chip&quot; key particular to
that chip. Once proper authorization has been secured by law enforcement and the
type of key escrow encryption technology has been identified, this chip key can
be secured by law enforcement to decrypt the contents of a communication.
Therefore, a question arises regarding whether individuals are surrendering
their encryption keys prior to the determination of probable cause. The system
currently being proposed is analogous to a system of registration by the
government so that it can maintain an ability to access the contents of stored
electronic communications or perform electronic surveillance.&lt;84&gt;</P>
<P><B>Third general issue.</B> In the third general issue&#151;Does government
prohibition against use of certain cryptographic technologies infringe
individual's right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment?&#151;a
government prohibition against the use of certain cryptographic devices would
only infringe on an individual's right to freedom of speech if the Supreme Court
determines encrypted speech to be a protected form of speech.&lt;85&gt;
Currently, the Court has made no determination on this issue. See the first
general issue (above) for a full discussion. </P>
<P><B>Fourth general issue.</B> In the fourth general issue&#151;Does
governmental control of certain cryptographic technologies through export/import
laws infringe individual's right to freedom of speech under the First Amendment?&#151;Congress
is granted the authority to control exports of articles for national security
purposes. The Constitution gives Congress the power to regulate foreign commerce
and to do what is necessary to provide for a common defense.&lt;86&gt; This
authority is expressed principally in three statutes: the Export Administration
Act (EAA),&lt;87&gt; the Arms Export Control Act (AECA),&lt;88&gt; and the
Invention Secrecy Act (ISA).&lt;89&gt; </P>
<P>Several law review articles have asserted that the EAA, the AECA, and the
ISA restrict scientific and technical speech that merits constitutional
protection.&lt;90&gt; These authorities cite (1) prior restraint without
judicial review, (2) overbreadth and vagueness, and (3) regulations not narrowly
tailored to a compelling state interest of national security.&lt;91&gt; Each of
these is discussed below.</P>
<P>The first assertion, prior restraint through a licensing scheme, can be
viewed as a lack of due process. Due process protects the liberty interests of
the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, which include the First Amendment rights.&lt;92&gt;
Since the landmark case of <I>Goldberg v. Kelly</I>, the Supreme Court has
required some form of due process in cases in which the government has sought to
deprive individuals of liberty or property interests.&lt;93&gt; The <I>Goldberg</I>
court required New York City to provide nearly full judicial process prior to
terminating welfare benefits. Other cases have firmly established this
principle.&lt;94&gt;</P>
<P>The second assertion, the overbreadth doctrine, applies when fully protected
speech is the object of regulation. This doctrine allows a defendant being
prosecuted under a statute affecting fully protected speech to argue against it
on the grounds that it restricts or &quot;chills&quot; the speech of others not
before the court.&lt;95&gt; The statute must have a real and substantial impact
on speech,&lt;96&gt; and it must be as narrowly drawn as possible.&lt;97&gt;
Whether the export control acts would survive an overbreadth attack would
presumably depend on whether the courts would regard the controlled speech as
incidental to conduct.&lt;98&gt; In <I>Edler</I>, the AECA and International
Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR) survived an overbreadth challenge because the
court read the definition of technical data as restricted data related directly
to specific articles that are subject to control and incidental to regulated
conduct, thus unprotected by First Amendment.&lt;99&gt; As written, the ITAR is
subject to an overbreadth attack; however, the judicial reaction is uncertain.&lt;100&gt;
The EAA seems more vulnerable to overbreadth attack due to the fact the
definition of technical data is much broader.&lt;101&gt; Although the Munitions
List that defines the scope of the ITAR is relatively specific, thus
facilitating the holding in <I>Edler</I>, the Commodity Control List is
extensive and contains a number of general catch-all entries.&lt;102&gt;</P>
<P>ISA offers the most difficult case of the three statutes. The authority to
extend a secrecy order extends to any invention, in the judgment of the head of
the interested government agency, that could be &quot;detrimental to national
security.&quot;&lt;103&gt; Neither the Act nor the regulations suggest any
standard of review or guidelines by which such a judgment could be made. The
lack of judicial review has the potential to restrain protected speech. Also,
ISA has no regulated items or conduct to which controls on speech might be
considered incidental. &quot;ISA purports to control information itself&#151;pure
speech,&quot; a circumstance where the overbreadth doctrine is most likely to be
applied.&lt;104&gt; However, if the Courts were to construe all information in a
patent application commercial speech, the overbreadth doctrine would be
inapplicable. Shinn considers this unlikely because the definition of commercial
speech is that proposing a commercial transaction, and patent applications
contain detailed technical descriptions of inventions, unrelated to proposing a
commercial transaction.&lt;105&gt;</P>
<P>The courts have consistently upheld that the export control laws are not
unconstitutionally vague.&lt;106&gt; The Supreme Court considers a criminal
statute unconstitutionally vague if it does not provide to the defendant and the
trier of fact &quot;reasonably clear guidelines&quot; in establishing whether a
crime has been committed so as to &quot;prevent arbitrary and discriminating
enforcement.&quot;&lt;107&gt; Also, a vagueness challenge can be addressed only
by the facts in the case before the court.&lt;108&gt;</P>
<P>In the third assertion, according to Shinn the export control regulations do
not fall within the national security exception for three reasons.&lt;109&gt;
First, the exception has been recognized only when the government sought an
injunction against publication of certain information, except in the special
circumstance of a Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) employee, in order to
protect classified information. Thus, except for the special case of the CIA,
the security exception to prior restraint amounts only to allowing the
government to seek an injunction. The concern with current export control laws
is that the government is not required to proceed in this manner. The possible
exporter of information must apply for a license that the government can deny at
will.&lt;110&gt; The case law makes clear that before any restraint upon
protected speech may become final it must be subjected to prompt judicial review
in a proceeding in which the government will bear the burden of justifying its
decisions.</P>
<P>Second, the cases invoking national security exception have all involved or
suggested a limitation to classified data. In contrast, the export laws aim
primarily at unclassified data. Although the EARs do not distinguish between
classified and unclassified information and the ITAR covers both classified and
unclassified information, the Acts control only exports of information to
foreign places, not release to American citizens. They are not necessary to
control export of classified information, which is subject to much stricter
regulation under executive order.&lt;111&gt; The national security exception is
limited to protecting classified information; it cannot support export control
laws concerned primarily with unclassified information.&lt;112&gt; The ISA
extends further than the EAA or AECA, because an invention secrecy order
requires that the invention be kept secret and forbids issuance of a patent. The
inventor is not able to disclose the information to anyone in the United States
or abroad. Therefore, the ISA imposes a kind of classification, although it does
not use the term.&lt;113&gt;</P>
<P>Finally, the national security exception standard of &quot;direct,
immediate, and irreparable damage&quot; to our nation could not conceivably be
satisfied in the wide range of circumstances covered by these statutes, which
regulate a full spectrum of ordinary commercial transactions.</P>
<P>The national security statutes clearly were not developed to regulate the
noncommunicative effects of exchanges between scientists. Congress desired to
control the dissemination of certain kinds of information because it feared what
potential or actual enemies of the United States might accomplish with that
information. It was the effect of the message on the audience, and not the means
or method of communication and its interference with the achievement of an
unrelated governmental purpose, that Congress intended to regulate.&lt;114&gt;</P>
<P>A recurring theme in cases implicating the First Amendment is the
requirement of a close relation between the law and a compelling state interest.
Therefore, a regulation that impinges on First Amendment values in order to
serve a compelling state interest, but which does not in fact serve that
interest, is subject to constitutional challenge. Shinn suggested three reasons
why the export laws, as applied to control the flow of scientific and technical
information, do not satisfy compelling state interest of national security. The
main paths of leakage to other countries is espionage directed toward classified
material and diversion of physical items of technology in violation of the
export laws.&lt;115&gt; A National Academy of Sciences study found that in
contrast to leakage from these sources, open scientific communications did not
present a significant danger, mainly because of the problems of translating
scientific knowledge into actual military usage.&lt;116&gt; Thus, if the export
laws have no effect on leakage through these two most important pathways, it is
difficult to see how controlling an unimportant path can serve national security
interests sufficiently to justify encroaching on First Amendment rights.&lt;117&gt;
Second, controls on scientific communications impede the progress and growth of
technology, thus reducing U.S. military capabilities. The Corson Report, in
examining the ways controls affect both military and economic security, stated
that a policy seeking national security through scientific achievement is
preferable to one based on secrecy. Third, a growing part of the world's
scientific and technological capability is outside the United States, thus
beyond control through export law. The Allen Report expressed this concern and
determined that in many areas unilateral controls by the United States were
ineffective because technology was available through other suppliers,&lt;118&gt;
a situation very similar to the current state of encryption technology. It is
hard to understand how the national interest is served by restraining
communication in an attempt to control information already available elsewhere.
Shinn notes that judgments about national security issues are better left to the
legislatures than to the courts. Yet, when publication of information has been
threatened, the courts have examined closely to see whether a sufficiently
important national interest is served.</P>

<H1>1.1.2.2  State of the law</H1>
<P>In a dissenting opinion, Justice Brandeis defined the constitutional right
to privacy as &quot;the right to be let alone&#151;the most comprehensive of
rights and the right most valued by men.&quot;&lt;119&gt; The Supreme Court has
recognized freedom of association as a necessary concomitant to the specific
guarantees of the First Amendment, since the exercise of freedom of speech, the
press, assembly, and petition routinely requires group activity.&lt;120&gt; &quot;[T]he
Constitution does not provide an explicit right to privacy, and therefore its
development has been slow and irregular.&quot;&lt;121&gt; In <I>Griswold v.
Connecticut</I>, the Supreme Court declared that various guarantees in the Bill
of Rights produce zones of privacy.&lt;122&gt; Specifically, the Court
recognized the zone of privacy formed by the First Amendment right of free
association, the Third Amendment prohibition of peace time quartering of
soldiers in homes without consent, the Fourth Amendment protection of
unreasonable search and seizure of private individuals by government, and Fifth
Amendment protection against self-incrimination.&lt;123&gt; The Constitution
only protects private individuals from governmental intrusion; protection from
private action is left to the states.&lt;124&gt; The language of the U.S.
Constitution has hindered judicial development of the right to privacy; however,
state constitutions have specifically recognized the right to privacy.&lt;125&gt;</P>
<P>In <I>Whalen v. Roe</I>, the Supreme Court distinguished between the &quot;privacy
of autonomy&quot;&#151;an &quot;interest in independence in making certain kinds
of important decisions&quot;&#151;and &quot;disclosural privacy&quot;&#151;an &quot;individual
interest in avoiding disclosure of personal matters.&quot;&lt;126&gt; The right
to privacy of autonomy has been recognized in decisions relating to marriage,
procreation, contraception, family relationships, obscene material in the home,
and child rearing and education.&lt;127&gt; Although the Court has continued to
develop a right to privacy of autonomy, it has rarely advanced the right to
disclosural privacy.&lt;128&gt;</P>
<P>Traditionally associated with the First and Fourth Amendments, disclosural
privacy concerns the right of an individual to control the flow of personal
information.&lt;129&gt; The Court has noted that freedom of association often
depends on the concealment of one's associations, by the prevention of
disclosure of information pertaining to a particular association.&lt;130&gt; The
Supreme Court has seldom recognized the constitutional right of disclosural
privacy,&lt;131&gt; and it has yet to find the right violated&lt;132&gt; except
in a Freedom of Information Act case which weighed the public interest in
disclosure against individual interest in privacy.&lt;133&gt;</P>
<P>In <I>Whalen</I>, the Supreme Court upheld a state statute requiring
disclosure of private medical information to state authorities.&lt;134&gt; The
Court emphasized the importance that the state restrictions placed on the
disclosure of medical information, which made public exposure unlikely.&lt;135&gt;
Of importance was the Court's recognition of the threat to individual privacy
posed by the government collection of personal information. Justice Stevens,
writing for the majority opinion declared:</P>
<P>We are not aware of the threat to privacy implicit in the accumulation of
vast amounts of personal information in computerized data banks or other massive
government files. The collection of taxes, the distribution of welfare and
social security benefits, the supervision of public health, the direction of
Armed Forces and enforcement of criminal laws, all require the orderly
preservation of great quantities of information, much of which is personal in
character and potentially embarrassing or harmful if disclosed. . . .
[N]evertheless New York's statutory scheme, and its implementing administrative
procedures, evidence a proper concern with, the protection of, individual's
interest in privacy.&lt;136&gt; </P>
<P>While recognizing the potential threat to privacy, the <I>Whalen</I> Court
refused to decide any question which might be presented by unwarranted
disclosure of accumulated data, whether intentionally or by a system that did
not contain comparable security standards.</P>
<P>Justice Brennan, in his concurring opinion, analyzed the restrictions placed
on dissemination of medical data by the statute and found sufficient safeguards
against unwarranted disclosure.&lt;137&gt; He cautioned that a constitutionally
protected privacy right would be implicated if the restrictions were not in
place and information was widely disseminated.&lt;138&gt; In a situation where a
protected privacy interest was threatened, the state must establish a &quot;compelling
interest&quot; to justify deprivation of the right to privacy.&lt;139&gt;</P>
<P>Justice Brennan, writing for the majority in <I>Nixon</I>, considered
disclosural privacy involving the Presidential Records and Materials
Preservation Act.&lt;140&gt; Under this Act, the Administrator of the General
Services Administration was directed to take custody of Nixon's presidential
papers and supervise their examination to determine which documents the
government would keep. Reviewing the Act's screening process, Justice Brennan
emphasized that the Act was written to minimize invasion of privacy and
concluded that no &quot;less restrictive means&quot; existed to accomplish the
purpose of the Act, and that Nixon's &quot;legitimate expectation in privacy&quot;
had not been violated.&lt;141&gt;</P>
<P>While in <I>Whalen</I> and <I>Nixon</I> the Supreme Court failed to find
that a constitutionally protected right to disclosural privacy had been
violated, the Court has held that a similar statutorily protected privacy was
violated under the Freedom of Information Act.&lt;142&gt; In <I>Reporter's
Committee</I>, the Court found a protected privacy interest in the disclosure of
personal information contained in a Federal Bureau of Investigation criminal rap
sheet.&lt;143&gt; Balancing the public interest in disclosure against the
individual interest in privacy, the Court found the former at its &quot;nadir&quot;
and the latter at its &quot;apex.&quot;&lt;144&gt; The Court concluded that
disclosure of law enforcement records is an unwarranted invasion of privacy.&lt;145&gt;
</P>
<P>While the Court has neither consistently recognized a disclosural privacy
nor clearly outlined requirements for raising a claim of disclosural privacy,
the Court seems to have determined the appropriate standard of review to be
applied.&lt;146&gt; A heightened scrutiny test is applied, balancing individual
interest in nondisclosure against government's interest in disclosure.&lt;147&gt;
</P>
<P>With an explicit constitutional right to privacy in personal information
held by the federal government absent, congressional legislation provided the
only remaining safeguard.&lt;148&gt; The Privacy Act of 1974&lt;149&gt; was the
first attempt by Congress to strike a balance between the government's interest
and need to gather personal information and individuals' competing interest to
keep control over personal information.&lt;150&gt; The Privacy Act requires
every federal agency maintaining a record on an individual within a system of
records to (1) allow the individual to control the use and dissemination of
information contained in the record; (2) allow the individual to review, to
correct, or to amend information contained in the record; (3) control and
restrict the collection, use, maintenance, and dissemination of information in
the record; and (4) be subject to civil suit for specified violations of the
Privacy Act.&lt;151&gt; </P>
<P>The first safeguard prohibits any federal agency from disclosing any
information contained in a system of records without written consent of the
individual to whom the record pertains. The scope of this prohibition on
nonconsensual disclosure, however, is subject to numerous exemptions. General
and specific exemptions allow the heads of federal agencies to promulgate rules
that exempt their federal agency's system of records from provisions of the
Privacy Act. </P>
<P>Specific exemptions exist for law enforcement purposes in response to
exigent circumstances.&lt;152&gt; Law enforcement officials may have access to
information in a &quot;showing of compelling circumstances affecting health or
safety of an individual if upon such disclosure notification is transmitted to
the last known address of such an individual.&quot;&lt;153&gt; </P>
<P>The broadest of these exemptions, the routine use exemption, permits
nonconsensual disclosure of personal information where the purpose for
collection is compatible with its use by the federal agency. Law enforcement
agencies, such as the CIA and the Department of Justice, have employed the
routine use exemption to avoid the restrictive language of an applicable
disclosure exemption.&lt;154&gt; Neither the federal agencies nor the Office of
Management and Budget have actively overseen the exemption's use, and statutory
and procedural barriers have precluded the courts from averting abuse of the
exemption through judicial review.&lt;155&gt; Because the final version of this
Act was a result of a last-minute compromise between competing House and Senate
bills, the Act has become an internally inconsistent statute with no reliable
indication of legislative intent. </P>
<H1>1.1.2.3  General issues addressed</H1>
<P><B>First general issue.</B> In the first general issue&#151;Does a
government prohibition against use of certain cryptographic technologies
infringe individual's right to privacy under the First Amendment?&#151;given the
direction of the Supreme Court's view of First Amendment privacy, this concern
would either be construed as a privacy &quot;interest in independence in making
certain kinds of important decisions&quot; (i.e., &quot;privacy of autonomy&quot;)
or an &quot;individual interest&quot; in controlling the flow of personal
information (i.e., &quot;disclosural privacy).&quot;&lt;156&gt; The Court
continues to actively develop the right to privacy of autonomy; however, the
right has only been recognized in decisions relating to family matters such as
marriage, procreation, contraception, family relationships, obscene material in
the home, and child rearing and education.&lt;157&gt; A government's attempt to
regulate cryptographic use does not naturally relate to decisions involving
family matters, and the Court has never decided if scientific or technological
matters would be viewed in such a manner. Thus, the prohibition or regulation of
certain cryptographic technologies would probably not offend the Court's current
view of an individual's right in privacy of autonomy. </P>
<P>Although the Court has continued to develop a right to privacy of autonomy,
it has rarely advanced the right to disclosural privacy.&lt;158&gt; In cases
involving the disclosural privacy doctrine, the Court's interpretation is
focused on the individual's interest in control of personal information. The
prohibition of certain cryptographic technology could implicate this doctrine.
However, all the cases implicating this doctrine involved instances where the
local or federal government by statute had the right to disclose certain
personal information. Therefore, it is not clear if the regulation of
cryptography would offend a legitimate privacy right under the First Amendment.
</P>
<P><B>Second general issue.</B> In the second general issue&#151;Is a key
escrow system that ensures government access to encrypted speech an invasion of
the right of privacy under the First Amendment?&#151;an encryption key escrow
system where the government is the escrow agent might implicate the disclosural
privacy doctrine, because it concerns the protection of an individual's interest
to control the flow of personal information and the government's interest in
gathering and controlling the use of personal information. The heightened
scrutiny test would be applied to balance both private and government interests
in disclosure of personal information. In light of the rationales used in both
<I>Whalen</I> and <I>Nixon</I>, the Supreme Court would weigh the individual
concerns in (1) the potential harm of disclosure of information and (2) the
individual's legitimate expectation of privacy in nondisclosure, versus the
government's concern in (1) the need to collect, use, or maintain individual
information; (2) the implementation of adequate administrative procedural
safeguards; and (3) the practice of the least restrictive alternative.&lt;159&gt;</P>
<P>A legitimate individual interest in the potential threat of disclosure of
private cryptographic keys could have serious detrimental effects on both
domestic and national security. Nonclassified data accumulated from an
increasing number of sources, including hostile governments or groups, could
adversely affect the national security of the United States.&lt;160&gt; Examples
of this information are weather and crop reports, trading reports, electronic
fund transfers, and various types of economic information.&lt;161&gt; This gives
the National Security Agency (NSA) reason to be concerned with the computer
security standards used by civil government agencies and private entities.&lt;162&gt;
</P>
<P>The cases interpreting this doctrine considered only a privacy interest in
information intimately related to that particular individual, for example, an
individual's criminal record, medical information, and personal papers. A
question could arise in assessing a privacy interest of an individual if the
desire to use any general nonclassified cryptographic technology can give an
individual a legitimate expectation of privacy. The cryptographic process is a &quot;reversible
process designed to make information unreadable to all but the intended
recipient;&quot; thus, a certain level of privacy is expected by a user.&lt;163&gt;
Yet, the legitimate expectation of privacy centers around the encrypted data,
not on the type of cryptographic technology used. Therefore, a Court must
resolve the scope of a legitimate expectation of privacy on encrypted
communications, which would probably be influenced to a certain extent by the
type of medium used to communicate.</P>
<P>A governmental interest within the law enforcement community is the future
widespread use of cryptographic technology in criminal activity and the enormous
impediment that creates in the electronic surveillance arena.&lt;164&gt; Also,
the Court would scrutinize the administrative procedures to determine if there
was proper protection of the encryption keys. Given the recent public disclosure
regarding the set-up of the key escrow system, it would seem that the government
has developed adequate procedural safeguards to ensure the protection of keys
from improper disclosure.&lt;165&gt; The Court might note the fact that two key
components are split between two escrow agents and are not personally
identifiable to the key escrow agents. The key components are received by an
authorized law enforcement official in encrypted form sent directly to a &quot;blackbox&quot;
in order to maintain confidentiality of the key components that make up the
decryption key.</P>
<P>The government is not collecting evidently personal information. The
escrowed key components are not related to particular individuals. The chip keys
are not formed and related to individuals until they are used, and they are
discarded after use. Because the government is not developing a database of
personal information, the requirement of privacy may not apply.</P>
<P>However, the proposed government key escrow system could be construed as the
collection, use, and maintenance of personal information, whereby the prescribed
key escrow agents (i.e., presumably a federal agency) could be subject to the
requirements of the Privacy Act. Even though the government would only directly
control the encryption keys and not the information itself, the maintenance and
use of the keys are intimately related to the access of private encrypted
information. The Privacy Act's main goal was to protect an individual interest
in controlling the use of personal information after its release to the
government.&lt;166&gt; One of these requirements prohibits any federal agency
from disclosing any information contained in a system of records, without
written consent of the individual to whom the record pertains. Yet, the scope of
this prohibition on nonconsensual disclosure is subject to numerous exemptions.
Specific exemptions exist for law enforcement purposes in response to exigent
circumstances, although keys may only be released through Title III and the
Federal Information Security Agency. However, the routine use exemption as used
by the CIA must be scrutinized closely by the Court for its potentially perilous
impact on the key escrow system.&lt;167&gt; </P>
<P><B>1.2  SECOND AMENDMENT&#151;RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS</B></P>
<H1>1.2.1  General Issues</H1>
<P>1. Should cryptographic technology be categorized as a weapon, such as a
gun, and thus regulated by the right to bear arms under the second amendment?</P>
<H1>1.2.2  State of the Law</H1>
<P>The Second Amendment states that &quot;a well regulated Militia, being
necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and
bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&quot;&lt;168&gt; It is an area of &quot;constitutional
jurisprudence that still awaits its philosopher.&quot;&lt;169&gt; The Supreme
Court has directly ruled on the Second Amendment in only four cases.&lt;170&gt;
The first three cases have recognized the individual right and a bar to federal
infringement of the right. The Court in <I>Miller</I> limited the Amendment
protection to weapons useful for militia duty. Since then, lower federal courts
have heard Second Amendment claims, often dismissing them on grounds that the
Amendment has not been incorporated into the Fourteenth Amendment, which would
make it binding on the states. Most of these cases pertained to persons involved
in criminal activity who were also convicted of firearms charges; thus these
cases were not really a &quot;good test of the extent to which the Second
Amendment protects the rights of the public at large.&quot;&lt;171&gt;</P>
<P>One legal scholar has recently examined the Second Amendment within the
context of the Bill of Rights and concluded the purpose of the Amendment as
preventing Congress from disarming freedmen, so that the public could resist
tyranny by a standing army.&lt;172&gt; However, some scholars believe the
purpose of the Second Amendment was to maintain the militia, not to provide an
individual right to bear arms.&lt;173&gt; Opponents of stricter gun controls
tended to stress the Amendment's clause arguing that the framers intended a
militia of the whole, who was expected to perform its duties with privately
owned weapons.&lt;174&gt; </P>
<H1>1.2.3  General Issues Addressed</H1>
<P>Currently, courts have not addressed the regulation of cryptography in the
context of a right to bear arms under the Second Amendment. However,
cryptographic technology is listed as a munition on the U.S. Munitions List
promulgated by the AECA. Nevertheless, cryptography would have to fall into the
limitation imposed by <I>Miller</I>, thereby construing cryptography as a
weapon useful for militia duty.&lt;175&gt; </P>

</LI>
<LI> Does requiring disclosure of the encryption key to the government in

</LI>
</OL>
<H1>1.3.1.2  State of the law</H1>
<P>The Fourth Amendment states that the &quot;right of people to be secure in
their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and
seizures, shall not be violated. . . .&quot;&lt;176&gt; This right protects
individuals against arbitrary invasions of their privacy by law enforcement
officials, thus preserving a balance between the needs of law enforcement and
those of individuals.&lt;177&gt; The Amendment restricts searches and seizures
that infringe upon an individual's reasonable expectation of privacy;&lt;178&gt;
with a few exceptions, a search warrant must be obtained prior to a search.&lt;179&gt;
Law enforcement officials are not required to obtain warrants for every search.
The police do not need warrants to conduct certain searches of automobiles,
searches incident to a lawful arrest, searches in emergency, or situations
involving hot pursuit.&lt;180&gt; </P>
<P>The courts used to construe the Fourth Amendment to protect only tangible
property against physical searches and seizures.&lt;181&gt; In 1967, the Supreme
Court in <I>Katz v. United States</I>&lt;182&gt; explicitly rejected the <I>Olmstead</I>
view, stating the Fourth Amendment protects &quot;people&quot; not simply &quot;places&quot;
against unreasonable search and seizure. &quot;What a person knowingly exposes
to the public, even in his own home or office, is not subject to Fourth
Amendment protection.&quot;&lt;183&gt; The Supreme Court has subsequently held
that a &quot;search occurs when an expectation of privacy that society is
prepared to consider reasonable is infringed.&quot;&lt;184&gt; Whether a person
has standing to contest a search on Fourth Amendment grounds depends on whether
the person had a legitimate expectation of privacy in the area searched, not
merely in the items seized.&lt;185&gt;</P>
<P>The Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA) amended Title III of the
Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Street Act. The ECPA extends the reach of Title
III to electronically stored information. The Act makes unlawful access to
stored communications, when a person intentionally accesses without
authorization a &quot;facility through which an electronic communication service
is provided&quot; or &quot;intentionally exceeds an authorization to access that
facility&quot; and thus obtains, alters, or prevents authorized access to a wire
or electronic communication while it is in storage in such system.&quot;&lt;186&gt;
Exceptions to this prohibition are made for entities providing &quot;wire or
electronic communications service,&quot; an &quot;intended&quot; user, or an
authorized government law enforcement officer.&lt;187&gt; </P>
<P>Section 2703 outlines the requirements for governmental access. The
government may require the disclosure by a provider of electronic communication
service of the contents of a communication in electronic storage, pursuant to a
warrant.&lt;188&gt; The government may require a &quot;provider&quot; of remote
computing services to disclose contents of an electronic communications,
pursuant to a warrant, without prior notice to the &quot;subscriber&quot; or &quot;customer.&quot;&lt;189&gt;
</P>
<H1>1.3.1.3  General issues addressed</H1>
<P><B>First general issue.</B> The first general issue&#151;May the government
seize encrypted electronic/computer stored documents or papers without prior
notification to owner?&#151;is addressed by the ECPA on two levels, depending on
the forum in which the electronic communication is being stored. Section 2703(a)
specifically states that an authorized government agency &quot;may require the
disclosure by a provider of electronic communication of the contents of
electronic communication&quot; in electronic storage, pursuant to a warrant.&lt;190&gt;
The contents of electronic communications that are &quot;held or maintained on
that service&quot; in a remote computing service environment can be disclosed to
an authorized government entity without required notice to the &quot;subscriber&quot;
or &quot;customer&quot; of this type of service, with a proper warrant.&lt;191&gt;
The ability to seize does not depend on the form of the contents of electronic
communication at time of seizure; thus encrypted speech is governed by this
statute.</P>
<P><B>Second general issue.</B> When the second general issue&#151;Does
requiring disclosure of the encryption key to the government in advance of there
being probable cause sufficient to allow the government to seize an encrypted
communication and to search and seize the key to such communication violate the
fourth amendment?&#151;is considered, given the current available information on
the procedures governing key escrow technology, a question arises: Is the
government requiring disclosure of an encrypted key prior to sufficient probable
cause? For each cryptographic device, the government has two key escrow agents.
Each agent will possess a unique encrypted component of the chip key along with
the identification number particular to that chip. Thus, an individual agent
does not have the capability to combine the components necessary to form a chip
key. Once proper authorization has been secured by law enforcement and key
escrow encryption technology has been identified, this chip key can be secured
by law enforcement to be used to decrypt the contents of a communication.
Therefore, a question arises regarding whether individuals are surrendering
their encryption keys prior to the determination of probable cause. The system
currently being proposed is analogous to a system of registration by the
government so that it can maintain an ability to access the contents of stored
electronic communications.&lt;192&gt;</P>

<H1>1.3.2.2  State of the law</H1>
<P>In <I>Berger v. New York</I>, the Supreme Court discussed the guidelines
for authorization of interception of communications. To obtain authorization,
the law enforcement official must particularly describe the place to be searched
and the persons or things to be seized, and the official must show probable
cause sufficient to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that an
offense has been or is being committed.&lt;193&gt; The order must describe &quot;the
type of conversation sought with particularity,&quot; by indicating the specific
objective of the government in &quot;entering the constitutionally protected
area&quot; and the limitations placed upon the officer executing the warrant.&lt;194&gt;
The limitations placed on the officer provide that the officer does not search
unauthorized areas and that the officer only seizes the property sought.&lt;195&gt;
The order must also limit the intrusion, and a new order may be issued if
probable cause is shown for a succeeding period of intrusion.&lt;196&gt; The
officer must make a report of how the order was executed and what was seized.&lt;197&gt;
The Court believed through these precautions that the &quot;danger of an
unlawful search and seizure was minimized,&quot; thus allowing the search to be
within the limits of the Fourth Amendment.&lt;198&gt;</P>
<P><B>Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Street Act. </B>In
formulating Title III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Street Act
[hereinafter referred to as &quot;Title III&quot;],&lt;199&gt; Congress
attempted to balance two important interests: the legitimate needs of the law
enforcement and the privacy concerns of the public.&lt;200&gt; Thus, Congress
outlined a comprehensive scheme for regulating the interception of wire or oral
communications. </P>
<P>Title III prohibits the use of any &quot;electronic, mechanical, or other
device&quot; for the interception of communications,&lt;201&gt; and such devices
can be seized or confiscated by the United States.&lt;202&gt; This prohibition
applies to all private eavesdropping and governmental eavesdropping without a
court order. It prescribes a punishment of a maximum fine of $10,000,
imprisonment for 5 years, or both for any person who willfully intercepts a wire
or oral communication, discloses the contents of an intercepted communication,
or uses such contents.&lt;203&gt; Furthermore, any attempt to commit, or solicit
another to commit, any of the above acts is a separate offense.&lt;204&gt; </P>
<P>Section 2511(2) provides certain exceptions to the broad prohibitions of &#167;
2511(1), permitting interception where the speaker has given prior consent, or
by employees of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), a common carrier in
the ordinary course of monitoring duties, or a &quot;person acting under the
color of the law to intercept a wire or oral communication.&quot;&lt;205&gt;</P>
<P>To perform eavesdropping, the principal federal or state prosecutor must
apply to a judge of competent jurisdiction for an eavesdrop order.&lt;206&gt;
The judge must find probable cause as to the commission of a crime, the
likelihood of intercepting relevant communications, and the failure of ordinary
investigation.&lt;207&gt; All orders must be limited in time.&lt;208&gt;
However, a temporary delay in obtaining the eavesdrop order may be allowed in an
exigent situation threatening the national security interest or characteristic
of organized crime, as long as application is made within 48 hours.&lt;209&gt;</P>
<P>Title III imposes an exclusionary rule on all eavesdrop evidence seized
without a court order. The rule requires that &quot;[w]henever any wire or oral
communication has been intercepted, no part of the contents of such
communication and no evidence derived therefrom may be received in evidence in
any trial, hearing, or other proceeding in or before any court, grand jury,
department, office, agency, regulatory body, legislative committee, or other
authority of the United States . . . if the disclosure of that information would
be in violation of this chapter.&quot;&lt;210&gt; </P>
<P>The following are pertinent definitions as used in Title III.</P>
<UL>
<LI> <B>Wire communication</B>&#151;any communication made in whole or part
through the use of facilities for the transmission of communications by the aid
of wire, cable, or other like connection between the point of origin and point
of recognition furnished or operated by any person engaged as a common carrier
in providing or operating such facilities for the transmission of interstate or
foreign communications.&lt;211&gt; 
</LI>
<LI> <B>Oral communication</B>&#151;&quot;any oral communication uttered by a
person exhibiting an expectation that such communication is not subject to
interception under circumstances justifying such expectation.&quot;&lt;212&gt;
</LI>
<LI> <B>Intercept</B>&#151;the &quot;aural acquisition of the contents of any
wire or oral communication through the use of any electronic, mechanical, or
other device.&quot;&lt;213&gt;
</LI>
<LI> <B>Contents</B>&#151;with respect to wire or oral communication, consists
of &quot;any information concerning the identity of the parties to such
communication or the existence, substance, purport, or meaning of that
communication.&quot;&lt;214&gt;
</LI>
<LI> <B>Investigative or law enforcement officer</B>&#151;any officer of the
United States or of a state or political subdivision thereof, who is empowered
by law to conduct investigations of or to make arrests for offenses enumerated
in this chapter, and any attorney authorized by law to prosecute or participate
in the prosecution of such offenses.&lt;215&gt;
</LI>
</UL>
<P>The legislative history of Title III stated that &quot;the major purpose of
Title III is to combat organized crime&quot; and cited the hardship in obtaining
proof as the primary reason for the lack of success in prosecution of this type
of criminal activity.&lt;216&gt; Six years after the passage of Title II, the
National Wiretap Commission evaluated the effectiveness of the statute.&lt;217&gt;
The majority of the Commission strongly reaffirmed the finding of Congress
during the enactment of Title III in 1968 that electronic surveillance is an &quot;indispensable
aid&quot; to law enforcement in finding evidence of crimes perpetuated by
organized criminals.&lt;218&gt; In 1986 the President's Commission on Organized
Crime reinforced the opinion that electronic surveillance is critical to the
successful investigation and prosecution of organized crime.&lt;219&gt;</P>
<P><B>Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. </B>In <I>Katz</I>, the Court
expressly preserved national security surveillance from the reach of its
decision that a warrant would be required for electronic surveillance.&lt;220&gt;
Justice White noted the unique requirements of electronic surveillance for
national security purposes, concluding no prior judicial review should be
required if the President or the Attorney General found surveillance reasonable
under the circumstance.&lt;221&gt;</P>
<P>This distinction between law enforcement and national security requirements
for electronic surveillance was subsequently recognized by Congress as well. In
enacting Title III, Congress specifically disclaimed any intention that its
provisions, or those of the Communications Act of 1934, should be construed to
affect the constitutional powers of the President to protect the United States
against hostile powers, to obtain foreign intelligence information, or to
protect against any other &quot;clear and present danger.&quot;&lt;222&gt;</P>
<P>In the leading case on this issue, <I>United States v. United States
District Court</I>, the Court concluded that the reservation of Presidential
authority in Title III represented merely a neutral statement by Congress that
the President has some degree of power in the national security area and was not
an attempt to expand, define or contract that power.&lt;223&gt; Thus, it was
necessary to review the constitutional authority, rather than a statutory basis
for surveillance authority.&lt;224&gt; The Court never addressed the legality of
the Executive to undertake warrantless electronic surveillance for national
security purposes.</P>
<P>Subsequently, Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act,
which provides exclusive means of authorizing various types of electronic
surveillance for national security purposes. Activities must be authorized in
advance by one of the seven district court judges designated by the Chief
Justice of the Supreme Court as members of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance
Court (FISC).&lt;225&gt; The government presents warrants in camera, ex parte
proceedings conducted under physical security measures designed to protect
sensitive national security information.&lt;226&gt; The Chief Justice also
designates three federal appeals court judges to review government appeals in
instances in which FISC judges have denied applications for warrants.&lt;227&gt;
</P>
<P>All applications to FISC require the Attorney General's approval.&lt;228&gt;
The FISC judge must find the location at which the surveillance is directed and
the procedures proposed by the government adequately minimize the acquisition,
retention, and dissemination of information concerning unconsenting persons.&lt;229&gt;
The application must be accompanied by an official statement for senior
government officials that the information sought relates to national defense or
foreign relations.&lt;230&gt;</P>
<P>The Act also contains detailed provisions specifying the requirements and
procedures mandated when information is intended to be used in a criminal
proceeding. Barring such situations or an emergency surveillance approval by the
Attorney General, there is no requirement to give notice to any target
concerning the fact the government has conducted such surveillance.&lt;231&gt;</P>
<H1>1.3.2.3  General issues addressed</H1>
<P><B>First general issue.</B> Regarding the first general issue&#151;In a
situation when one or both users of the proposed key escrow system are located
outside U.S. borders, does a warrant requirement exist for the U.S. government
to seize voice or data communication between the users?&#151;the Supreme Court
has held that the Fourth Amendment, particularly its warrant requirement, is
inapplicable outside the United States.&lt;232&gt; Given the proposed key escrow
system, obtaining a warrant under Title III for electronic surveillance if one
of the sources is located in the United States should present no problem. The
government in this instance would wiretap only the line of the source located in
the United States. Thus, only in the case where both sources are located outside
the United States is it not clear that a warrant requirement exists.</P>
<P><B>Second general issue.</B> Regarding the second general issue&#151;Does
requiring disclosure of the encryption key to the government in advance of there
being probable cause sufficient to allow the government to seize an encrypted
transmitted communication and to search and seize the key to such communication
violate the fourth amendment?&#151;see the discussion above in a stored
communications context.&lt;233&gt; The system currently being proposed is
analogous to a system of registration by the government so that it can maintain
its ability to perform electronic surveillance.&lt;234&gt;</P>
<P><B>1.4  FIFTH AMENDMENT&#151;SELF INCRIMINATION</B></P>
<H1>1.4.1  General Issue</H1>
<P>1. Does a key escrow system that may involuntarily secure from the user the
key to decipher the user's encrypted messages violate the Fifth Amendment's
privilege against self-incrimination?</P>
<H1>1.4.2  State of the Law</H1>
<P>The Fifth Amendment, in relevant part, states that &quot;[n]o person . . .
shall be compelled&lt;235&gt; in any criminal case to be a witness against
himself.&quot;&lt;236&gt; In <I>Fisher v. United States</I>, 425 U.S. 391
(1976), the Court framed the modern interpretation of Fifth Amendment privilege.
The Court held that the compelled production of documents, even if the contents
are incriminating, does not violate the Fifth Amendment unless the person is
compelled to make a testimonial communication.&lt;237&gt;</P>
<P><B>The production of incriminating evidence</B>. The Court in <I>Fisher</I>
noted that the compelled production of evidence containing incriminating
evidence did not automatically invoke Fifth Amendment privilege. The Court
stated that the &quot;Fifth Amendment does not independently proscribe the
compelled production of every sort of incriminating evidence but applies only
when the accused is compelled to make a testimonial communication that is
incriminating.&quot;&lt;238&gt; The Court recognized that &quot;[a] subpoena
served on a taxpayer requiring him to produce an accountant's workpapers in his
possession without a doubt involves substantial compulsion. But it does not
compel oral testimony; nor would it ordinarily compel the taxpayer to restate,
repeat, or affirm the truth of the contents of the documents sought.&quot;&lt;239&gt;
The Court further stated that the Fifth Amendment would not be violated &quot;by
the fact alone that the papers on their face might incriminate the taxpayer, for
the privilege protects a person only against being incriminated by his own
compelled testimonial communications.&quot;&lt;240&gt; </P>
<P>The Court analyzed the voluntary nature of the evidence produced. With
respect to the papers being subpoenaed, &quot;the preparation of all of the
papers sought . . . was wholly voluntary, and they cannot be said to contain
compelled testimonial evidence, either of the taxpayers or of anyone else.&quot;&lt;241&gt;
&quot;The fact that the documents may have been written by the person asserting
the privilege is insufficient to trigger the privilege, . . . [a]nd unless the
Government has compelled the subpoenaed person to write the document, the fact
that it was written by him is not controlling with respect to the Fifth
Amendment issue.&quot;&lt;242&gt; In essence, the government cannot compel a
person to involuntarily create evidence to incriminate himself, whether in the
form of a written admission of guilt, development of document, etc. But the
government may compel the production of voluntarily created documents, even if
documents are self-incriminating.&lt;243&gt; </P>
<P><B>Fifth Amendment and the Fourth Amendment's Right to Privacy and
Protection from Unreasonable Search and Seizure. </B>The Court commented on the
relationship between the Fifth Amendment's self-incrimination clause and the
Fourth Amendment's privacy and unreasonable search and seizure clauses. The
Court, in its analysis of privacy, recognized that &quot;one of the several
purposes served by the constitutional privilege against compelled testimonial
self-incrimination is that of protecting personal privacy. . . . But the Court
has never suggested that every invasion of privacy violates the privilege.
Within the limits imposed by the language of the Fifth Amendment, . . . the
privilege truly serves privacy interests; but the Court has never on any ground,
personal privacy included, applied the Fifth Amendment to prevent the otherwise
proper acquisition or use of evidence which . . . did not involve compelled
testimonial self-incrimination of some sort&lt;244&gt; . . . . We cannot cut the
Fifth Amendment completely loose from the moorings of its language, and make it
serve as a general protector of privacy&#151;a word not mentioned in its text
and a concept directly addressed in the Fourth Amendment. We adhere to the view
that the Fifth Amendment protects against `compelled self-incrimination, not
[the disclosure of] private information.'&quot;&lt;245&gt;</P>
<P>With respect to self-incrimination and unreasonable search and seizure, the
Court commented on a line of cases in which the Fifth Amendment was offended by
the use of evidence of documents or property seized in violation of the Fourth
Amendment.&lt;246&gt; However, the Court in those cases also found elements of
compelled self-incrimination.&lt;247&gt; &quot;[I]n either case he is the
unwilling source of the evidence, and the Fifth Amendment forbids that he shall
be compelled to be a witness against himself in a criminal case.&quot;&lt;248&gt;</P>
<P>The Court also noted that &quot;under the appropriate safeguards private
incriminating statements of an accused may be overheard and used in evidence, if
they are not compelled at the time they were uttered.&lt;249&gt; . . . [W]hen
the state['s] reason to believe incriminating evidence will be found becomes
sufficiently great, the invasion of privacy becomes justified and a warrant to
search and seize will issue.&quot;&lt;250&gt;</P>
<H1>1.4.3  Conclusion</H1>
<P>1. Does the compelled production of a &quot;key&quot; to decipher encrypted
messages amount to self-incrimination as defined by the Fifth Amendment?</P>
<P>Although there are no cases that directly address this issue, it appears
from past decisions that the government's compelled production of a &quot;key&quot;
to decipher messages would not violate the Fifth Amendment's privilege against
forced self-incrimination. The procurement of the key itself is not testimonial
in nature, and it in no way incriminates the person from whom the key is
procured. But, even if it can be concluded that the procurement of the key is in
essence the procurement of the communication to be deciphered, the Court has
stated that if the communication was voluntary, no right has been abridged by
the government's compelled production of that evidence. In <I>Doe v. United
States</I>, the Court noted that if a compelled statement is &quot;not
testimonial and for that reason not protected by the privilege, it cannot become
so because it will lead to incriminating evidence.&quot;&lt;251&gt; Also in <I>Doe
v. United States</I>, Justice Stevens, in his dissenting opinion, observed that
a person &quot;may in some cases be forced to surrender a key to a strongbox
containing incriminating documents.&quot;&lt;252&gt; This analogy fits well with
the key escrow function and lends further support to its constitutionality on
Fifth Amendment grounds.</P>

<H3>2.1  DOMESTIC CONTROLS</H3>
<H3>2.1.1  Computer Security Act of 1987</H3>
<P>The Computer Security Act requires federal agencies to identify and develop

intended to prevent persons from illegally tapping into government computer
systems and altering or destroying records.&lt;253&gt; The Act gives the
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) responsibility for
promulgating guidelines to protect the security of sensitive but unclassified
computer information.&lt;254&gt; The term &quot;sensitive information&quot;

telecommunications equipment fall into the ADPTE category.&lt;256&gt; The
General Services Administration is responsible for providing ADPTE to federal
agencies either directly or under a delegation of procurement authority.</P>
<P>Over the Act's 25-year history, the most important development involved the
ability for certain agencies to exempt themselves from ADPTE purchasing
requirements. The Warner Amendment passed in 1981 exempted certain Defense
Department purchases from the Brooks Act provisions.&lt;257&gt; These purchases
included any Defense Department procurements &quot;critical to the direct
fulfillment of military or intelligence missions&quot; of the United States or
in which the ADPTE exists as an &quot;integral part of a weapon or weapons
system;&quot; these purchases also included &quot;cryptologic activities related
to national security.&quot;&lt;258&gt; </P>
<P>NIST provides cryptographic technology for unclassified government
information primarily pursuant to the Brooks Act.&lt;259&gt; The Act explicitly
grants control over national security information data processing needs to the
President, who in turn has delegated that task to the NSA or other military
agencies.&lt;260&gt; </P>
<H3>2.2  EXPORT CONTROLS</H3>
<P><B>2.2.1  Arms Export Control Act, 22 U.S.C. &#167; 2778</B></P>
<P>The AECA is the statutory authority that governs export controls of defense
articles and services to foreign countries. The purpose of the AECA is to
control the export of defense articles that may contribute to an arms race,
support international terrorism, increase the possibility of outbreak or
escalation of conflict, or prejudice the development of bilateral or
multilateral arms control arrangements.&lt;261&gt; Thus, &quot;[i]n furtherance
of world peace and the security and foreign policy of the United States, the
President is authorized to control the import and the export of defense articles
and defense services. . . . The President is authorized to designate those items
which shall be considered as defense articles and defense services for the
purposes of this section and to promulgate regulations for the import and export
of such articles and services.&quot;&lt;262&gt; </P>
<P><B>2.2.1.1  International Traffic in Arms Regulations</B></P>
<P>The ITAR, 22 C.F.R. &#167;&#167; 120-130, promulgates the policies set forth
in the AECA. The State Department is given exclusive regulatory authority to
carry out the ITAR by the President. </P>
<P><B>U.S. Munitions List.</B> Items considered defense articles and services
appear in the U.S. Munitions List,&lt;263&gt; and individual validated export
licenses must be approved for these items. The designation of items to appear on
the Munitions List is handled by the State Department in concurrence with the
Defense Department. Designations of articles to the Munitions List is based
primarily on whether the article or service is deemed to be inherently military
in character. Whether an item is used for both military and civilian purposes
does not determine whether it will be placed on the list. Also, the intended use
of the article is not relevant in determining whether an item will be subject to
restrictions.&lt;264&gt;</P>
<P>The determination of items to be placed on the Munitions List is not
judicially reviewable.&lt;265&gt; However, the AECA provides for periodic review
of items appearing on the Munitions List to determine which items no longer
warrant export restrictions under the AECA and ITAR. For an item on the
Munitions List to be decontrolled, a request to remove the item from the list
must be received by the State Department. The State Department reviews the item
with the appropriate agencies and determines whether the item should be
decontrolled. Items decontrolled by the State Department may be placed on the
Commerce Control List, and control of these items accordingly shifts to the
Commerce Department.&lt;266&gt;</P>
<P><B>Export licenses. </B>Defense items appearing on the Munitions List are
under the exclusive jurisdiction of the State Department. Those wishing to
export items on the Munitions List must be registered with the State Department
prior to submitting an export license application. Any person intending to
export a defense article must obtain an individually validated license from the
State Department prior to each export. An application for the permanent export
of defense articles sold commercially must be accompanied by a purchaser order,
letter of intent, or any other appropriate documentation.&lt;267&gt; With
respect to distribution warehouses, the initial agreement for warehousing and
distributing defense articles must be approved by the State Department before
they enter into force. The agreement must contain conditions for special
distribution, end-use, and reporting and must specify the terms and conditions
in which the article will be exported, the duration of the agreement, and the
countries involved in the distribution territory.&lt;268&gt; Licenses for
exports pursuant to a distribution agreement must be approved prior to export.
</P>
<P>An export license is required for the export of unclassified technical data.
A license must be obtained for any oral, visual, or documentary disclosure of
technical data to foreign nationals during visits to foreign countries by U.S.
persons, visits by a foreign national to the United States, or any other
situation. A license is required regardless of the manner in which the technical
data are transmitted, whether the transfer be in person, by telephone, through
correspondence, or electronically.&lt;269&gt; However, information which is in
the public domain&lt;270&gt; is not subject to the controls for technical data.</P>
<P>In determining whether to issue an export license, consideration must be
given to whether an article will contribute to the arms race, support
international terrorism, increase the possibility of outbreak or escalation of
conflict, or prejudice the development of bilateral arms control arrangements.
When considering applications, recommendations from other agencies may be
sought. These recommendations are used to aid in determining whether to grant
export licenses. </P>
<P><B>Violations and penalties. </B>The export or attempt to export any
defense article or technical data or to furnish any defense service for which a
license is required without obtaining the required license or violating any of
the terms or conditions of a granted license is prohibited under the ITAR.&lt;271&gt;
Persons granted export licenses are responsible for the acts of their employees,
agents, and all persons entrusted with the operation, use, possession,
transportation, and handling of licensed defense articles or technical data
abroad.&lt;272&gt;</P>
<P>It is also a violation for a person to knowingly apply for a license, or
order, buy, receive, use, sell, deliver, store, dispose of, forward transport,
finance, or otherwise participate in any transaction involving a defense article
or technical data, for the benefit directly or indirectly of a person facing
debarment or suspension.&lt;273&gt; In addition, it is unlawful for a person to
willfully aid, abet, cause, counsel, demand, induce, procure, or permit the
commission of any act prohibited by the ITAR.&lt;274&gt; It is also unlawful to
use any export control document containing false statements, misrepresentations,
or omissions of material facts for the exporting of any defense article or
technical data or the furnishing of any defense service for which a license is
needed.&lt;275&gt;</P>
<P>Any person willfully violating any part of the AECA or the ITAR or, in a
registration, license application, or report, willfully making untrue statements
of a material fact, omitting a material fact, or making misleading statements
shall, upon conviction, be subject to fine, imprisonment, or both.&lt;276&gt;
For criminal offenses, the fine shall be not more than $1,000,000 or
imprisonment not more than 10 years, or both, for each violation.&lt;277&gt;
Civil penalties shall be in accordance with those set forth in the Export
Administration Act, 50 U.S.C.S. App. 2410 (c), which may not exceed $500,000 for
each violation.&lt;278&gt; Civil penalties may be in addition to or in lieu of
any other liability or penalty which may be imposed.</P>
<P>U.S. Customs may take the appropriate steps to enforce the regulations set
forth in the ITAR. U.S. Customs may inspect the loading or unloading of any
vessel, aircraft, or vehicle or order the production of any relevant documents
or information pertaining to a particular export.&lt;279&gt; </P>
<P><B>2.2.1.2  ITAR controls on encryption technology</B></P>
<P>Category XIII(b)(1) of the Munitions List covers cryptographic equipment.
Originally section (b)(1) of the category consisted of &quot;[s]peech
scramblers, privacy devices, cryptographic devices and software (encoding and
decoding), and components specifically designed or modified therefore, ancillary
equipment, and protective apparatus specifically designed or modified for such
devices, components, and equipment.&quot; Recent amendments to the ITAR have
decontrolled specific categories of cryptographic equipment. These amendments
removed cryptographic technology involving message authentication, access
control devices, television descramblers, automatic teller machines, virus
protection, and &quot;smart cards,&quot; and placed these items under Commerce
Department jurisdiction. Also, certain (but not all) types of mass-market
software have been decontrolled. All other items remain under State Department
jurisdiction.&lt;280&gt;</P>
<P>Export applications involving cryptography are reviewed by the State
Department and then reviewed by the Defense Technology Security Agency, the
Energy Department, the appropriate Military Services, and the NSA. The
application must include the proposed use of the item and the end user of the
item. Recommendations from the aforementioned agencies to approve or reject the
application are then sent to the State Department, and the State Department
makes the final decision on the license.</P>
<P>Certain types of mass market software still under State Department control
may be approved on an expedited basis. Software involving RC2/RC4 algorithms may
be approved in 7 days, whereas other software may be approved in 15 days. Also,
other less powerful algorithms may appear on an &quot;automatic&quot; list,
which is a list of commonly approved noncritical items still under the control
of the State Department which are immediately approved. The Data Encryption
Standard (DES) and other strong algorithms are not eligible for approval under
this schedule. DES may be approved for financial institutions and U.S.
subsidiaries through the normal approval process. However, generally
cryptographic technology used to encrypt data is not approved. Only those used
for message authentication and access control are approved.</P>
<P><B>2.2.2  The Export Administration Act of 1979, 50 U.S.C.S. app.</B></P>
<H3>&#167;&#167; 2401&#150;2420</H3>
<P>The EEA of 1979 and its subsequent amendments are designed to strengthen the
international commercial commerce position of the United States. This Act
implements policies designed to &quot;minimize uncertainties in export control
policy and to encourage trade with all countries with which the United States
has diplomatic or trading relations, except those countries with which such
trade has been determined by the president to be against the national interest.&quot;&lt;281&gt;
This policy was based on the findings of Congress that &quot;[e]xports
contribute significantly to the economic well-being of the United States and the
stability of the world economy by increasing employment and production in the
United States, and by earning foreign exchange, thereby contributing favorably
to the trade balance. . . . It is important for the national interest of the
United States that both private sector and the Federal Government place a high
priority on exports, consistent with the economic, security, and foreign policy
objectives of the United States.&quot;&lt;282&gt;</P>
<P>As a result of these and other findings and policy considerations, the EEA
declares that restrictions on exports may be used </P>
<P>only after full consideration of the impact on the economy of the United
States and only to the extent necessary&#151;</P>
<P>(A) to restrict the export of goods and technology which would make a
significant contribution to the military potential of any other country or
combination of countries which would prove detrimental to the national security
of the United States;</P>
<P>(B) to restrict the export of goods and technology where necessary to
further significantly the foreign policy of the United States or to fulfill its
declared international obligations; and</P>
<P>(C) to restrict the export of goods where necessary to protect the domestic
economy from the excessive drain of scarce materials and to reduce the serious
inflationary impact of foreign demand.&lt;283&gt;</P>
<P><B>2.2.2.1  Export Administration Regulations</B></P>
<P>The EARs, 15 C.F.R. parts 768&#150;799, promulgate the policies set forth by
the EEA. The Commerce Department is given regulatory authority over the export
control of commodities.</P>
<P><B>Commerce Control List. </B>Commodities under the control of the Commerce
Department appear on the Commerce Control List (CCL). The Commerce Department
requires export licenses for the export of goods or technologies that appear on
the CCL. Licenses that may be required include (1) a validated license for a
specific export; (2) a validated license for multiple exports, which include
distribution licenses, comprehensive operations licenses, project licenses, and
service supply licenses (see 50 U.S.C.S. app. 2403); (3) a general license; and
(4) other licenses as required under the EEA.</P>
<P>The following groups of items are not controlled under the EARs and do not
appear on the CCL:</P>
<UL>
<LI> U.S. Munitions List,
</LI>
<LI> narcotics and dangerous drugs,
</LI>
<LI> commodities subject to Atomic Energy Act,
</LI>
<LI> watercraft,
</LI>
<LI> natural gas and electric energy,
</LI>
<LI> tobacco seeds and plants,
</LI>
<LI> endangered fish and wildlife, and
</LI>
<LI> patent applications (secrecy orders).
</LI>
</UL>
<P><B>Export Licenses. </B>The export of all commodities appearing on the CCL
and technical data&lt;284&gt; requires a general license (if established) or a
validated license or other authorization for export granted by the Office of
Export Licensing, except for the following: </P>
<UL>
<LI> any export to Canada for consumption in Canada, unless an individual
validated license is required;
</LI>
<LI> exports for the official use of or consumption by the U.S. Armed Forces;
and
</LI>
<LI> exports of commodities and technical data controlled by another U.S.
agency.&lt;285&gt;
</LI>
</UL>
<P>A general license is one for which no application is required and for which
no document is granted or issued. It is available for use by all persons, except
by those specifically prohibited from exporting commodities.&lt;286&gt; These
general licenses are only applicable to exports under the licensing authority of
the Commerce Department.&lt;287&gt;</P>
<P>A validated license is a document issued by, or under the authority of, the
Commerce Department authorizing a specific export.&lt;288&gt; Types of validated
licenses include (1) individual license, (2) project license, (3) distribution
license, (4) service supply license, and (5) special chemical license.&lt;289&gt;
</P>
<P>The Commerce Department will, when applicable, consult with other
appropriate agencies before approving an export application requesting a
validated license. Foreign policy concerns (which involve restrictions of
certain exports to certain countries) and national security concerns will be
taken into consideration when an application is being evaluated.&lt;290&gt; If
an application is denied, notification will be provided within 5 days to the
applicant. The notice will state the statutory basis for the denial, the
policies that will be furthered by the denial, the specific considerations which
led to the denial, and the availability of appeal procedures.&lt;291&gt; The
EARs provide procedures for appeals of denied applications. </P>
<P>The Commerce Department reviews items on the CCL at least every 3 years for
multilateral controls and every year for all other controlled commodities. In
the review, commodities presently under the validated license control are
reviewed to determine whether such a control is still warranted, and commodities
that may be exported under general license to most destinations are examined to
ascertain whether controls should be extended or expanded.&lt;292&gt;</P>
<P><B>Violations. </B>Anyone who willfully violates or conspires to or
attempts to violate any provision of the EEA with knowledge that the exports
involved will be used for the benefit of, or that the destination or intended
destination of the goods or technology involved is to, any controlled country or
any country to which exports are controlled for national security or foreign
policy purposes, shall be subject to penalties. Except in the case of an
individual, the violator shall be fined not more than 5 times the value of the
exports involved or $1,000,000, whichever is greater; or, in the case of an
individual, the violator shall be fined not more than $250,000, or imprisoned
not more than 10 years, or both.&lt;293&gt; </P>
<P>Any person who is issued a validated license under this Act for the export
of any goods or technology to a controlled country and who, with knowledge that
such goods or technology is being used by such controlled country for military
or intelligence gathering purposes contrary to the conditions under which the
license was issued, willfully fails to report such use to the Secretary of
Defense shall be subject to penalties. Except in the case of an individual, a
violator shall be fined not more than five times the value of the exports
involved or $1,000,000, whichever is greater, or, in the case of an individual,
shall be fined not more than $250,000, or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or
both.&lt;294&gt; </P>
<P>Civil penalties may be enforced and may not exceed $500,000 for each
violation. Civil penalties may be in addition to or in lieu of any other
liability or penalty which may be imposed.&lt;295&gt;</P>
<P><B>2.2.2.2  Encryption technology on the Commerce Control List</B></P>
<P>Requirements for licenses of encryption technology appear in Category 5,
Part II&#151;Telecommunications, Information Security, in Supplement No. 1 of
the CCL. All items with encryption capabilities that are controlled by the
Commerce Department appear in this section. All encryption technology, with a
few exceptions, require a validated license.&lt;296&gt;</P>
<P>Initially, all encryption technology appeared in the ITAR and was controlled
by the State Department, but recent amendments moved some of these items to the
CCL. Cryptographic items now controlled by the Commerce Department are those
involving message authentication, access control devices, television
descramblers, automatic teller machines, virus protection, and &quot;smart
cards.&quot; Also, certain (but not all) types of mass-market software have been
decontrolled by the State Department. Mass market software not decontrolled
remains under the control of the State Department.&lt;297&gt;</P>
<P><B>2.2.3  Invention Secrecy Act, 35 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 181&#150;188</B></P>
<P>The Invention Secrecy Act prevents the disclosure of patent applications
filed in the Patent and Trademark Office for inventions made in the United
States. Patent applications containing subject matter that may be detrimental to
the national security if disclosed are subject to secrecy orders.</P>
<P>Regulations issued by the Patent and Trademark Office govern the export to
foreign countries unclassified technical data in the form of a patent
application or an amendment, modification, or supplement. These regulations are
found under 37 C.F.R. part 5. </P>
<P><B>Secrecy orders. </B>Patent applications containing subject matter that
may be detrimental to national security interests if disclosed are made
available for inspection by defense agencies.&lt;298&gt; If it is determined
that the disclosure or publication of the invention by granting a patent would
in fact be detrimental to the national security, the Commissioner, upon request
from the defense agency, will issue an order that the invention be kept secret.&lt;299&gt;
The secrecy order is directed to the subject matter of the patent application.&lt;300&gt;
The secrecy order is enforced against the applicant, successors, any and all
assignees, and any legal representatives.&lt;301&gt;</P>
<P><B>Petitions for rescission of secrecy order. </B>A petition to rescind or
remove a secrecy order may be filed by the applicant, assignees, or legal
representatives.&lt;302&gt; The petition must include all facts that support a
showing that the order is ineffectual or futile, or it may show where other
applications not subject to a secrecy order disclose a significant part of the
subject matter of the application under secrecy order.&lt;303&gt;</P>
<P><B>Petitions to export. </B>Generally, if a secrecy order has been issued,
an application cannot be exported to or filed in a foreign country.&lt;304&gt;
However, a permit to disclose or modification of a secrecy order may be granted
upon petition. The petition must fully recite the reason or purpose for the
disclosure and all countries in which the petitioner wishes to file as well as
all attorneys, agents, and others to whom the material will be consigned before
filing in a foreign patent office.&lt;305&gt; The permit or modification may
contain conditions and limitations on disclosure or filing.&lt;306&gt;</P>
<H3>2.3  IMPORT CONTROLS</H3>
<H3>2.3.1  Temporary Imports (Intransit)</H3>
<P>Items imported into the United States which may subsequently be reexported
to another country are considered temporary imports. These items may be items
that are intransit or merely passing through the United States from one country
to another, or the item may be one that is sent to the United States for
repairs, maintenance, etc. These items which are imported may be items that
require export licenses from the State or Commerce Department. A temporary
import license will allow the reexport of those items, even though such a
license for a regular export may not be granted.</P>
<H3>2.3.1.1  Import jurisdiction</H3>
<P>The State Department regulates the temporary import of defense articles
which appear on the U.S. Munitions List. Permanent imports of defense articles
into the United States are regulated by the Treasury Department&lt;307&gt; (see
27 C.F.R. parts 47, 178, and 179).</P>
<H3>2.3.1.2  Temporary import licenses </H3>
<P>A temporary import license is required for the temporary import and
subsequent export of unclassified defense articles, unless exempted in
accordance with 22 C.F.R. 123.4. Licenses from the State Department are required
for (1) temporary imports of unclassified defense articles that are to be
returned directly to the country from which they were shipped to the United
States, and (2) temporary imports of unclassified defense articles in transit to
a third country.&lt;308&gt; </P>
<H3>2.3.1.3  Encryption technology controls</H3>
<P>The encryption devices that appear in Category XIII of the U.S. Munitions
List are regulated by the State Department for temporary importation.</P>
<H3>2.3.2  Permanent Imports</H3>
<P>Items that are imported into the United States as a final destination for
use or consumption are considered permanent imports. Typically, the Bureau of
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms (Treasury Department) regulates the import of
defense articles. The FCC also regulates a few items pertaining to
communications. These two agencies may affect the import of encryption
technology if the item falls within its jurisdiction.</P>
<H3>2.3.2.1  Treasury Department, Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms and Tobacco
controls</H3>
<P>The Treasury Department regulates the permanent importation of defense
articles which appear on the U.S. Munitions Import List.&lt;309&gt; This list
was developed from the U.S. Munitions List, minus items not subject to controls.
Category XIII, consisting of encryption technology, has been deleted from the
U.S. Munitions Import List, and those items are not controlled by the Treasury
Department. </P>
<P><B>2.3.2.2  Federal Communications Commission controls</B></P>
<P>Pursuant to the Communications Act, 47 U.S.C.S. &#167; 302a, the FCC has
regulations prohibiting the importation of scanning devices equipped with
decoders that convert digital cellular transmissions to analog voice audio or
scanning devices that may receive transmissions allocated to cellular radio
telecommunications service. The control of the import of these items may involve
items using encryption technology.</P>
<H3>2.3.2.3  Commerce Department controls</H3>
<P><B>Regulation. </B>The Commerce Department will receive from the importers
in the United States the representations regarding the intended destination of
commodities.&lt;310&gt; An importer will certify to the exporting country that
he will import specific commodities into the economy of the United States and
will not reexport such commodities except in accordance with the export
regulations of the United States.&lt;311&gt;</P>
<P><B>Violations and sanctions.</B> A maximum fine of $10,000 or imprisonment
for 5 years, or both, may be imposed for those making willfully false statements
or concealing material fact or knowingly using a document containing a false
statement in any matter.</P>

<P>&lt;83&gt;Another method suggested has been fair public-key cryptography.
This method differs from a key escrow system in that users voluntarily choose to
register their keys, whereas in the Clipper Chip proposal the keys are
registered as a component of the manufacturing process. Also the keys are
associated with users; by comparison, the Clipper Chip proposal would associate
the keys with the chip identification number. See Meeting of the Computer System

Bobby Iman, former Director of NSA and Deputy Director of the CIA. Despite a

<P>&lt;235&gt;&quot;Word `compel' as used in constitutional right to be free
from being compelled in a criminal case to be a witness against one's self means
to be subjected to some coercion, fear, terror, inducement, trickery or threat&#151;either
physically or psychologically, blatantly or subtly; the hallmark of compulsion
is the presence of some operative force.&quot; Black's Law Dictionary.</P>

<P>&lt;237&gt;&quot;In order to be `testimonial,' an accused's oral or written
communication, or act, must itself, explicitly or implicitly, relate a factual
assertion or disclose information. It is consistent with the history of and the
policies underlying the Self-Incrimination Clause to hold that the privilege may
be asserted only to resist compelled explicit or implicit disclosures of
incriminating information.&quot; <I>Doe v. United States</I>, 487 U.S. 201

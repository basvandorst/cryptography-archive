01a:	Fixes from Phillip Vandry <vandry@staple.mlink.net>

	- The multipart messages did not have two CRLFs before the
	  boundary, which is not compliant with RFC1521

	- pgpsign was not calling PGP with +Armor=off, which could cause
	  signature data to be both ascii armored AND base64 encoded!

01:	Update to be compliant with the "01" draft.

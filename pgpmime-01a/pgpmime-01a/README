This set of code is intended to be an example as to how to implement
MIME security with Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) according to the internet
draft "draft-elkins-pem-pgp-01.txt" using metamail.

First, you should check the Makefile to be sure that everything is ok
for your environment.

Now do a "make install".

Included are sample mailcap entries that you should use in conjunction with
metamail to make this system work (see sample.mailcap).

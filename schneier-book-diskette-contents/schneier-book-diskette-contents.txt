Attached is the contents of the two-disk set associated with APPLIED
CRYPTOGRAPHY.  Assuming you are a U.S. or Canadian citizen residing in
the U.S. or Canada and promise not to export the disks, you can get a
copy of the disks by sending $30 to my address below.

Much of this code is available on various ftp sites, so you could save
yourself some money by surfing for this stuff yourself.

Cheers,

Bruce

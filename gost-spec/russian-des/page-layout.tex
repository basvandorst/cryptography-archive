		% Page Structure of the Document

%     The plain.tex \plainoutput routine will surrounded with one or
% two bells and whistles, but not modified as such.  It is thus
% renamed

	\let\plainplainoutput=\plainoutput

% so that it can be called in the new

\def\plainoutput
{\ifodd\pageno \hoffset=\oddhoffset\else \hoffset=\evenhoffset\fi
 \plainplainoutput \global\firstpagefalse}%

% The first page of the document is handled differently from any
% of the others, so the page routine needs a flag to distinguish it.

		\newif\iffirstpage 

% The head and foot lines make provision for five fields running
% from far left through center to far right.

\headline={\llap{\farlefthead\kern 10pt}%
	   \rlap{\lefthead}\hss\clap{\centerhead}\hss\llap{\righthead}%
	   \rlap{\kern 10pt\farrighthead}}%
\footline={\llap{\farleftfoot\kern 10pt}%
	   \rlap{\leftfoot}\hss\clap{\centerfoot}\hss\llap{\rightfoot}%
	   \rlap{\kern 10pt\farrightfoot}}%

% To support two sided printing, the \hoffset varies from odd to even
% pages.  These two values are given the names:

	\newskip\oddhoffset
	\newskip\evenhoffset

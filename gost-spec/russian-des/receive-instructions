    The tar file `russian-des.tar.Z.uuenc' should be about 47K bytes
in length.  It can be unpacked into the directory `russian-des' which
will appear as a subdirectory of the directory in which the following
commands are given.

	(If you are working in Emacs, write a keyboard macro that
	 picks up the current line, executes it as a shell command,
	 and moves down seven lines.  Then call it three times.)

(a) Type:

	uudecode russian-des.tar.Z.uuenc

    which will produce a file called `russian-des.tar.Z' 
    of about 34K bytes.

(b) Type:

	uncompress russian-des.tar.Z

    which will replace `russian-des.tar.Z' with a file called
    `russian-des.tar' of about 82K bytes.

(c) Type:

	tar -xpvf russian-des.tar

    which will produce a directory called `russian-des'
    in the directory from which you are operating.

    It may now be necessary to change the ownership of the files to
yourself.

    The directory russian-des contains a READ.ME file, which
in turn contains an explanation of the contents of the directory
and instructions for TeXing and printing the document.

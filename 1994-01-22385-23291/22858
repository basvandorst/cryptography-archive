That's been said about many people a lot better than you.

But the honest people are cyberanarchist extremeists too. Or will
be when the Permanent Wiretaps get installed...

Truth. You think you have a monopoly? You think you have any?
You don't even know who *exists* and have taken the actions of
someone who doesn't want you to think he is real as evidence that
he isn't. Good.

Look, if you're going to be threatening people, come threaten me.
I have other worries that make whatever you could do look pitiful.

When the two-way Tv gets installed in your house, you're going to be

Actually, jerk, if the government weren't so caught up in sending the
BATF to burn down rogue religions and catch tax evaders maybe they
would have *time* or *prison space* to deal with the guy who stole
about $ 200,000.00 from my family and got out on bail and stole again
from one of the State Reps around here, and then got out on bail
again.

>oh, yes. the government doing something upsetting, like prosecuting you

I dunno. Laws against jaywalking are not equivalent to laws against
murder. The government agrees with this, and is putting more effort
into stopping jaywalking now. Get real.

Used to be the process worked a lot like that. It was called "democratic

Keep in mind that from the view of the Crown, they *were* just Anarchist

He ain't paying me a damn dime. In fact, I'm not even sure he's
*talking* to me these days. Liking Tim May isn't a qualification for
disagreeing with you. Simply not thinking he's the antichrist is
sufficient.

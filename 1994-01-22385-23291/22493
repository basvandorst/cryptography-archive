It can be done with O(1) storage ( under 1 Kbyte for 128-bit hash
function) and still in O(2^(n/2)) time on a general-purpose computer
using a rho attack. (I mentioned this a few weeks ago too).  Claiming
a minimum complexity for an attack is always a dangerous thing to
do. There are a very large number of algorithms, so before claiming
that there doesn't exist one to do a given job in a given time/space
one should be really sure of one's facts.

2^64 iterations is not out of reach of custom hardware. Wiener showed
the design of a $1M DES-breaker (with conservative CMOS technology)
that searches the 2^56 keyspace in 3 hours - it if took 2^8 longer
(768 hours) it would still be feasible. [However, the rho hash
function attack is not as easily parallelized as a DES keyspace
search].

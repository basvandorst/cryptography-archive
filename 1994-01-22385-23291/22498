Actually, I'm fairly certain that the 1st amendment will prevent the Feds
from making alternate forms of encryption illegal -- just as they can't make
you speak in English in order to understand what you're saying.

What we need is a good, non-patented add-on box for regular or cellular phones
that will provide end-to-end encryption, beyond the control of the gov't or
the telcos.  (If you try to patent it, the gov't will just take it away from
you under "national security" laws -- but if you publish it on the net, it'll
be forever beyond anyone's control :-)

Recall that NSA has mucho experience with things like key
distribution algorithms, compartmented and multilevel security, 
and security in distributed systems such as networks.  

From an NSA perspective, as a _technical_approach_ key escrow
falls with in the domain of methods used in a secure system.
It's probably better than some of the alternatives -- 
unwillingness to attack the key assignment/distribution problem
has led to security breaches in the past -- as in the
"theatre-wide keys" stolen by the Walker spy ring and sold
to the Soviets.  I suspect that that incident had in impact
on NSA's key distribution philosophy.

In any case, from an engineering perspective, escrow is
not "insecure".   I am however opposed to mandatory escrow
proposals, however.

They "feel that" they have such access becasue it is legally granted
to them by presidential directives with the concurrence of Congress.
They are not simply being presumptuous.

It used to be that national techincal information such as
intelligence wiretaps could NOT be used for domestic
law enforcement.  Unfortunately, the b.s. surrounding the
war on Some Drugs has clouded that important safeguard.

I'd like to believe that, but my impression are all big on
privacy, but only for other mainstream Americans.  If you're
at all different -- counterculture, gay/lesbian, dissident etc. --
then the "community value" is to violate your privacy.

Hello,

can you help me with the following problem:

I want to protect program codes P1, P2, ... (or other data) from 
changes (e.g. by a virus). Together with the Program Code Pi I 
store its message autenticity code MAC(Pi). Only me (or a 
protected part of the OS) must be able to compute the function MAC. 
(Therefore MAC should make use of a secret key k).

Attackers can know arbitrary many pairs (Pi, MAC(Pi)).

No attacker should be able to forge a pair (P', MAC(P')).

One possibility to do this is to use a hash function in combination
with a digital signature scheme. Digital signatures are a very 
powerful cryptographic tool, since they can be veryfied without the 
knowledge of the secret key. 

If I don't bother about this property, there should be a easier and
more efficient solution than digital signing. For example any 
modification of MD5, using a secret key.

What I am looking for is no ad hoc solution, but a trustworthy one,
where the security can be proved under a basic assumption. 
(For example: "If MD5 is collision free, then MAC is secure.")

Does anyone know a scheme like this? Any suggestions?

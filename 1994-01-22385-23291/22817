While I can't cite you a decision on point, I would expect a public key 
signature, like a PGP-signed document, would stand up, as long as there 
was additional evidence that the originator of the secret key (the signing
 party) in fact had the secret key.  Assuming honesty in discovery (an 
 essential, but not always true, assumption) the alleged signer's secret 
 key could be used to test the validity of the signature by using it to 
 encrypt a new file in a monitored test that would prove to normal 
 evidentiary standards, that the signature that appeared on the challenged
 document was necessarily generated by the secret key of the alleged 
 signer.  That could then shift the burden of proof to the alleged signer 
 to prove that he/she somewhat lost control of the secret key, thus 
 enabling someone to forge his/her signature.  
 
The issue really shouldn't be much different, analytically, from proving 
that a mechanically signed check was in fact signed by the alleged signer.

Why should we go to such lengths as the timing of nuclear decay
when the inherent noise of a resistor, forward-biased diode or
other seminconductor junction is already Gaussian? Given, we have
some nonmonotonicity in whatever a-to-d conversion gives us 
that stream of random bits resulting from the lsb's (for instance)
of digitized noise, but the bias should then be easy to measure
and correct if we are for example producing single random bits.
Am I missing something?

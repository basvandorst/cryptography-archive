RIPEM suggests 512 bit numbers for non critical applications and 1024 bit
for very critical applications. Basically, it depends on the time frame the
encrypted data is useful for. For example, suppose you were sending a message
to a confederate about plans to be implemented the next day. A 512 bit key
would be more than adequate since an opponent wouldn't be able to break this
key in a day i.e. prior to you implementing your plan. If this were someting
that needed protection for say 10 years, a 512 bit key probably wouldn't be
adequate.

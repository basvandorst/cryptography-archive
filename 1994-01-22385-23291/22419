I'm wondering if you unintentionally left out a word in that last one.
Didn't you mean to say "so no one ELSE can read"?  From a SIGINT
point-of-view, the ideal would be WEAK encryption that APPEARS to be strong.
SIGINT usually relies on stealth.  If an adversary knows that someone is
listening, or at least COULD BE, they tend to be careful what they say.
Suddenly, all SIGINT-acquired data becomes "sanitized" and virtually
worthless.

To stir up so much debate over crypto would be counter-productive for any
hypothetical "Big Brother" agency.  And attempting to ban or restrict
crypto, predictably, has that very effect.  Let people know how potentially
insecure the standard channels of communication are, and the value of any
potential SIGINT is diminished.  Get me paranoid that "they" are listening,
and I'll only discuss important things in face-to-face, in the middle of an
randomly-chosen vacant field.

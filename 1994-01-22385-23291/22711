You just want to obfuscate?

Okay, a couple of suggestions:
1.  XOR the password string before compiling, and then XOR again when
    running to recreate the password - this will defeat strings & od,
    though not disassembly/use of a debugger.
2.  build up the password with non-sequential characyers, eg:
        char    password [5];
        ...
        password [0] = 'f';
        ...
        password [2] = 'e';
        ...
        password [4] = '\n';
        password [3] = 'd';
        password [1] = 'r';
        use (password);

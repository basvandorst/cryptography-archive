Consider the case of a replicated database or file server, where many
users are permitted to make updates at one site to "their" part of the
database, and their updates are automatically propagated to other
replicas, encrypted under a key shared between the replicas.

If an attacker can observe the cyphertext exchanged between replicas,
one has the conditions needed for a chosen-plaintext attack on the key
shared between the replicas.

Also, consider that the linkage between ciphertext blocks in DES in
its standard CBC mode is *very* weak, and each block can be attacked
individually; if one knows the plaintext of a block at a known offset
in the middle of a DES-CBC stream, one can do a known-plaintext
brute-force attack on the key used to encrypt the stream.

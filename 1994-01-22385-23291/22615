Because of the intense interest in Clipper, a simple question has led to a
rehash of much of the partisan discussion and argument about Clipper.

I think we have long since answered the original question, and all points of
view on just about every point with respect to Clipper. It is clear where
different people stand, and the issues have been given a good airing.

It's probably time to give it a rest yet again.

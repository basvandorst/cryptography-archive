The WP Corp encryption for v6.0 is much better than the v5.x stuff.
It uses a form of DES but is still breakable on a good i386 or i486.
Unfortunately, I can't tell you all the details of the algorithm since
I signed a non-disclosure with AccessData who makes a product (that I
co-developed) called "WRPASS".  The new version of WRPASS will recover
passwords for WordPerfect 6.0 (both DOS and Windows versions).  The
list price for WRPASS is $185.  For more information call
800-658-5199  (I believe this is the correct phone number this time :^).

I plan to upload the demo version of WRPASS in the next few days or
so.  I'll post something when it is available.

I don't know.  I suspect they use one-time pads and concealed radio 
receivers.  You are aware of numbers stations?  These are unidentified
voice transmitters in the 30mHz range that come on the air at various
times with no identification.  A voice enunciates numbers.  The 
numbers stop, and the carrier is gone.  The broadcasts are in various
languages.  A friend tells me that in Texas, Spanish is the usual 
language.  

There is even a newsletter devoted to numbers stations, Monitoring Times,
I've heard.  There have been a lot of speculation what they mean, and
I suppose attempts to decrypt them.  But I've heard that the numbers
appear to be random, which suggests secret communications with one-time
pads.

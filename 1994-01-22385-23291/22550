Can someone give me a list of manufacturers of those little things that
look like pocket calculators that just display an ever changing (but
obviously predictable to someone) access number? I'd like to see if it
is possible to integrate support for one of those things with
in.telnetd (that is if the manufacturer doesn't already do that).
I am especially interested in dealing with a company that will release
implementation details rather than handing me an API library or some
such nonsense (down with security by obscurity!).

Thanks in advance.

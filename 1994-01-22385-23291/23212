I would like to know how many cases there are relating cryptology and Justice.
For instance, some months ago, several technicians encrypted the source code
of a company, but they had to write down all the keys and passwords they had
at the Court request. Of course, it is a complex story, but the legal document
asking for paswords is very interesting for anyone reading this message. 
Isn`t it?

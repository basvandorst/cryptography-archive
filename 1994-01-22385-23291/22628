Hmmm ... how much would it speed up a software DES if one had
a hardware initial permutation device?  Such a device  would be
a relatively simple one to wire up for the PC ISA bus .. particularly
if memory mapped rather than in the IO space, but either would be easy
to wire ... 8 sequential output ports with latches crosswired to
8 sequential input ports (with the same addresses) for reading the data
back in.

I guess my question is .. for anyone who has done the coding, what 
percentage of the time is spent in the initial permutation compared 
to the rest of the routine?  Unless it was over 25 percent, I wouldn't
consider a hardware bit shuffler worthwhile.

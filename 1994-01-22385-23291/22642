David,
  While it is true that just about every aspect of the government has some
potential for abuse, most parts of the government [at least the respectable
ones] have fairly high visibility.  It may be possible for the IRS to swoop
down on you and confiscate your house because they claim you didn't file a
tax return form XYZ2340 for 1997 projected income yet, but were they to do
so, people would notice.  Were they to do so with any frequency lots of
people would notice.  And get annoyed.  Etc.

  The problem with something like Clipper is that it DELIBERATELY creates
new ways for the government to abuse its power WITHOUT being noticed by the
public at large.  The other agencies/powers you mentioned can't do that
[except for the FBI e.g. at Waco, but even that was controvercial].  So
I fail to see what's wrong with the assumption that the government should
not be capable of "getting away with" any more than it has to.

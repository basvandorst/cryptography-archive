Hardware Random Number Generator.
 
It seems to me that the construction of a Random Number Generator in
hardware should be neither difficult nor expensive.
 
I have in mind a generator in which the source of a random output
signal would be a small gas discharge tube.  (In the UK this is the method
used to generate random numbers in connection with a government lottery). 
 
My view is that such a unit should be included with every personal computer
-- alternatively that it should be possible to install such a unit within
any computer or connect it externally to any computer.
 
I should greatly appreciate advice from anyone who has experience in
connection with hardware rndom number generators and I would particularly
welcome circuitry and constructional details.
 
Another way of tackling the problem:  Can such a unit be purchased at a
reasonable cost ?
 
 
Thanks for any help which you can provide

   RIPEM suggests 512 bit numbers for non critical applications and 1024 bit
   for very critical applications. Basically, it depends on the time frame the
   encrypted data is useful for. For example, suppose you were sending a message
   to a confederate about plans to be implemented the next day. A 512 bit key
   would be more than adequate since an opponent wouldn't be able to break this
   key in a day i.e. prior to you implementing your plan. If this were someting
   that needed protection for say 10 years, a 512 bit key probably wouldn't be
   adequate.

He wasn't asking about key-size.  He was asking about the value of 'e',
the public exponent.

Actually, this vulnerablility is only in pure RSA.  None of the public
key programs (PGP, PEM, RIPEM, etc) use pure RSA.  Instead, they have
a packet format inside the RSA block which causes a loss of
multiplicitivity, and this, in turn, breaks the vulnerability.

Hope this helps.

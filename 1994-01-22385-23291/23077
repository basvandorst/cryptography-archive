I have written a script to mail the latest PGP FAQ by Gary Edstrom and
my "Here's How to MacPGP!" guide to anyone who sends me mail with the
Subject "Bomb me!". This way I can continue to be helpful without having
to do much! So....

WHENEVER YOU SEE, "Duh, uhhh, where's da FAQ?" QUESTIONS in the crypto
groups or PGP questions in other groups, FIRE OFF AN E-MAIL OR POST,
SAYING, "Send mail to na48138@anon.penet.fi, with "Bomb me!" as the
subject." The "na" means "not anonymous".

Do it do it do it do it....

Thank-you.

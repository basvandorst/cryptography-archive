The one I carry (2 years old?) works like this:

1.	the user ID is just an ID, and the card doesn't know it
2.	there is a database relating user ID to card encryption key
3.	the card holds a clock and encrypts the clock value (I believe)
	every minute with the internal key, displaying digits from the result
4.	in my card, there's a PIN as well.  I enter the PIN in the card and
	the card adds it (without carry) to the displayed value, for the
	next 5 minutes.
5.	the computer does the same operation and checks for equality.

Note: I can set/change the PIN myself by just using it while the host
computer is in a PIN setting mode -- and the receiver can derive it -- but
an eavesdropper can't.

The computer learns the time (I believe) by trying various computations for
neighboring minutes and looking for a match.  I believe the algorithm is
one-way and I'm sure it involves more digits than the 6 my card shows.

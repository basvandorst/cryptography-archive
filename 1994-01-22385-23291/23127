/encryption, you'd simply keep Salt in erasable PROM, with a "kill"
/switch available.
/ 
/   Once the Salt's been destroyed, no amount of coercion will retrieve
/the actual key.

Or have destructors installed around the disks.  If the place is about
to be compromised, someone flicks up a cover, and throws this switch and it
gets very noisy (or thermite starts dribbling through the drive's covering
bubble if flying parts of computer are a concern)...

Several switches could be installed at different locations, each of which
destroys sensitive stuff like computer drives, etc.

I was rather surprised something like that wasn't activated in Iran.
Its used in military aircraft, located all through the electronic gear.
Or it was done in the 50s...

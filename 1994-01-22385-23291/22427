AHA!  First you say it is "illegal to export cryptos", now you
are saying "certain kinds of cryptos".  You're backpedalling.

Cryptos are indeed exported.  For example, I recall a KY-57 crypto 
unit being in Saudi Arabia.  That unit was manufactured by Bendix in 
the U.S.  Saudia Arabia is not the U.S.

That's just off the top of my head; there are LOTS of U.S.
cryptos out there internationally.

I count this as whining.   Surely a few #ifdefs will fix
things right up.

Unless, of course, your software is poorly organized.

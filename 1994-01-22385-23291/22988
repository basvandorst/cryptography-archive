Contact Mykotronx Inc.

357 Van Ness Way, Suite 200, Torrance, CA 90501
Tel: (310) 533-8100  Fax: (310) 533-0527

It is my understanding that the databooks should be available now, and
the chips may be also.  Get a hold of Myko and ask.  The Capstone is
model number MYK-80.  The Clipper comes in three flavors: MYK-78E,
MYK-78T, and MYK-77.  They are nice people at Myko; I'm sure they will be
glad to help you.  Don't forget to ask for information on there other
products ;-).

   The NSA is the largest employer of mathematicians in the world. 
   Where did you get the idea that they employ "few mathematicians"?

It's the CIA that has the guys with trenchcoats and briefcases;
as Bob points out, the NSA does have a lot of mathematicians, and many
of them have been focussing on crypto-related theory for a long time.
On the other hand, there are a *lot* of mathematicians out there,
and maybe the guy who discovers why factoring is really easy :-) won't
be one of their employees; maybe it'll be somebody from Russia or China,
or maybe some Russian mathematician who discovered it years ago will
finally publish it in the West now that the Former Evil Empire Army isn't
paying mathematicians very much....

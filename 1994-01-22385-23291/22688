Hello Greg, we make the EXACT product that you need - its called Unishred
Pro, and meets DIS regulations and other government and military standards.
However, the format command does NOT wipe the entire disk - large portions
of the disk are untouched.  Only Unishred Pro cleans the entire disk.
Please contact me to tell me if you are interested in this or not.
 
Here is a product description:

LAT UniShred Pro is a government certified software solution to declassify SCSI 
hard disks.  LAT UniShred Pro meets rigid DoD, DoE, DIS (Defense Investigative 
Service), and commercial security standards.  LAT UniShred Pro completely 
removes all classified data, including data in bad blocks, alternate cylinders, 
and unallocated areas of SCSI disks.  LAT UniShred Pro is designed for military 
and commercial users who maintain the highest security standards. LAT UniShred 
Pro has built-in options to remove data according to standard data remanence 
removal guidelines.  LAT UniShred Pro has two utilities: a file and directory 
overwrite program that can be used as a direct replacement of the UNIX rm 
command, and an overwrite program for an entire SCSI hard disk.  The program 
currently ships with an intuitive graphical user interface or in a command-line 
version.  LAT UniShred Pro supports systems using SunOS 4.x, Sun CMW, Solaris2, 
HP/UX 8.x and IBM AIX.  Prices start at $829.

Sincerely yours,

Doug Webber

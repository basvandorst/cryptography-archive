den Boer and Bosselaers demonstrated at EUROCRYPT '93 so-called
"pseudocollisions" in MD5 which are collisions in MD5's internal
compression function having no impact on the security of MD5 itself.
See 'pub/md5-pseudo.tex' on rsa.com for more discussion.

The differential attack on MD5 is by Tom Berson, and was not
successful.

No collisions are known for either MD4 or MD5.

Dear netters,

	Two security requirements for cryptographic hash functions are
collision free and one-way (non-invertible).  It does not seem to exist any
mathematical method to prove a hash function satisfy these two requirements,
Are there any substitute to verify the degree of security for a hash function?

	I heard from a professor at school that there are four criteria for
cryptographic hash functions: avalanche, zero-one balance, independence, and
un-bias, which are detailed in some paper. However, I don't know exactly the
author and the publication year.  Could anyone out there please tell me which
paper it is?  Are there any books, journal articles, conference paper, etc.
with information related to any of these four criteria?  Or please give me
some suggestions?  Thanks a lot!

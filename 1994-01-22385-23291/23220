If you use simple Huffman-Encoding, then the bytes of the original mail
are being replaced by bit-strings of different length. If you XOR the
resulting bytes, it should be hard to break this, because you don't know,
when a plaintext byte begins and when it ends, also if the Huffman tree
is known.

I had the problem with cyphered speech-samples. We believe this method to
be very effective.

Comments welcome,

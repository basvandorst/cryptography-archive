Actually there has been a process in place for many years that requires them
to justify such things to the Office of Management and Budget, which is
pretty good at reducing government data collection to the essentials. No
government agency may promulgate a form without such OMB approval.

Dunno about Steve, but my message is the following:
When the government imposes regulations agreed upon by the people (read
Congress), then complying with such regulations is as much a cost of doing
business as any other. One may not pick and choose as between the
regulations one likes (the environment, occupational health and safety) and
the regulations one does not (national security, export and import, etc.)
EXCEPT as you can persuade Congress or the Administration to change them.

Thus in the case we are discussing, two versions of software may be
required. This is non-trivial, but is a cost of doing business. Those who
cannot afford such a cost have no more right to be in business than those
who "cannot afford" to comply with anti-pollution regulations.

I recognize that not everyone agrees with this position, but it is mine.
I further suggest that it is the social consensus.

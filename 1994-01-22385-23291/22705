LUC is a public-key system developed by a group of researchers based in 
New Zealand. Like RSA, it can be used for encryption, signature, and key 
exchange. LUC is based on large integers in a Lucas sequence, which is one 
of the less-well-known aspects of number theory.  It is similar to RSA but, 
is sourced outside the U. S. and, its inventors claim, is not subject to the 
RSA patent..

Its inventors claim it is cryptographically stronger than RSA. At least, it 
seems to be of comparable strength and computational complexity to RSA.

As you know from previous postings by others, the TV program
Nova recently aired an episode on WW II codebreaking.
There wasn't much in it that would be surprising to sci.crypt
readers.  In fact, I was surprised at the 1994 copyright--
some of the stories seemed out-of-date, like the 
implication that Polish cryptanalysts were able to break Enigma
largely due to Asche's spying.

Still, it was a worthwhile show & if you missed it, you may want to
get a copy.  According to the blurb at the end of the show,
videotapes of the episode are available for $19.95 by calling
(800)255-9424.  Transcripts are available for $5 by calling
(303)831-9000.

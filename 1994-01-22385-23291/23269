Hi!!

In fact, there is a way to reverse 'one row' of S-boxes through a chosen
plaintext attack. This can give you the 'key' if you know the plaintext, or the
'plaintext' if you know the key.

Statistically, there are 2^16 = 65536 ways to reverse one set of S-boxes, but
in a chosen plaintext attack (on one set of S-boxes) this number can usually be 
reduced to below 5.

If this method can be used to crack the complete DES (16 rows of S-boxes), 
however, I doubt. Anybody know anything about it??

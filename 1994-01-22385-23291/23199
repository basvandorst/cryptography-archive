I don't disagree with this point. However, I wonder if it is necessary to
transform random values from Poisson distribution to an uniform distribution
even if the difference (error) between the two was not small. The question
I am trying to answer is if I have a set of numbers which are randomly drawn
and have no correlation with one another, are they sufficient for crypto
purposes even if their distribution differs significantly from uniform?

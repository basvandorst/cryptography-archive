Easy enough. Bill has a copy of his own public key on his keyring. There should
be no problem in getting disclosure of it in a court case. If the message
validates using that key, Bill sent it. Since the public key was in this case
obtained directly from Bill's keyring, it would be highly unlikely that Bill
would be keeping a key with his own user id on it but generated by someone
else.

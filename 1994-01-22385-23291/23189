I can too. It's called the one-time-pad

If this were true, we would have to kill you for telling everybody

I would be interested in what percent saturation the grays are. I could
at least calibrate my camera.

It is true that many of us carry devices which totally control our thoughts
and actions. Lorena Bobbit showed that the device *could* be removed without
killing the host, though.

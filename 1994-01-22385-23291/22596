I don't know what the first 13 bytes are, but the rest of the message is
the first part of the Microsoft Windows SETUP.TXT file, which starts as
follows:

	SETUP.TXT
	=========
	
	This file contains information about problems that may occur
	while running Windows Setup and describes problems that can
	occur when using terminate-and-stay-resident (TSR) programs
	or drivers with Windows or Windows Setup. If you are using
	a TSR or if you encounter problems setting up Windows version
	3.1, read this document BEFORE running Setup again.

The autokey block could be run backwards to pick up the first few bytes,
but it didn't seem worth the effort.  I broke it by crib-dragging, as
suggested in my previous message about this thing; after trying some
short cribs like ".  The " and " encryption " and "Scott Wanex" :) and
so on, I tried 20 spaces in a row -- this produced likely-looking stuff
like:

  46: Period 13, crib "                    ", position 982:
	: : : : : : :.. :.. :.. :.f :.f :.f :.fpj.6 .3..g.tx.X8ghd

which looks like something real is happening, so I figured repeated
somethings were the right crib to look for; repeated dots weren't any
better, but repeated dashes worked, giving the following bust:

  60: Period 13, crib "--------------------", position 752:
     --------..If you are using an MS-DOS screen saver, you shoul

From here it was clear we were home free.  Again, for a more substantial
reward than a week's gratitude one could figure out what the 13-character
keyword is.  It's not in web2. :-)

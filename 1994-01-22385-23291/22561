Please excuse a possibly naive question from a crypt newbie, but
could somebody tell me what's wrong with this idea:

Use one of the public key schemes to send a file of
non-algorithmically-generated random numbers from A to B, and then use
one-time-pad encryption to send further messages.

(I'm under the impression that one-time-pad encryption is unbreakable
unless the pad is compromised, and further that it is fairly difficult
to break other ciphers if the plaintext is both unknown and random.)

Thanks,

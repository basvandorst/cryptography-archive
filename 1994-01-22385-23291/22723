Sorry to get off the political topics and onto some crypt stuff,
but here goes :)
 
Could someone explain to me exactly how Unix takes a password,
and ends up with what you see in the /etc/passwd ?
 
If I've got it right, unix takes the user password, runs it
through an algorithm, adds a salt, and ends up at a 13 character
output.  Is this correct?
 
Now what I'm wondering is:
 
(1) Is this a one way hash of the user password?  And is the
output always the same length? (Whether the user has a 1 
character or 8 character password)
 
(2) Where does the 'salt' come into play?  Is it just a fixed
length of random text tacked onto the end, or is it blended
in?
 
(3) Is there some problem with 'shadow' password systems? 
From what I've read, I can't understand why someone wouldn't
use that on their Unix...
 
 
Thanx

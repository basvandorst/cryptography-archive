Sorry to add another followup but the idea of this "black box" is even more
flawed than the original Clipper proposal:

-1- As with Clipper, there will probably be one party with the entire key
    who inserts it into the box.  This party is an SPF.

-2- Compared with the difficulty of adding an undetectable trapdoor to the
    Clipper cryptosystem [and people don't doubt too strongly that it exists
    although that would mean this 'key escrow' thing was a charade] adding a
    backdoor to the black box to allow the 'expire' timer to be reprogrammed
    would be trivial.  Especially since most people won't have these 'black
    boxes' to inspect.

-3- Even in the absense of deliberate trapdoors, most cryptosystems are very
    succeptible to a CHOSEN plaintext attack [note: distinct from a known
    plaintext attack] and I have seen no evidence that Clipper is different
    from other cryptosystems in this regard.  So giving the spooks the black
    box would give them the key with which they could do whatever they wanted.

BTW, what would be your objection to fixing the escrow system to work as I
had described earlier?  The approach I described would have no single-point
failure mode that I'm aware of, whereas Clipper has several (the existence of
_any_ SPF in a multi-escrow system defeats the purpose of multi-part escrow)

Why try to extend DES?  Use it as a whitening function.  For years on this
group I've pushed:

	compress|des|tran|des|tran|des

and for people who want more speed, there's also:

	compress|des|tran|prng-xor|tran|des

[Versions of tran and prng-xor are available on ripem.msu.edu (in
/..../other) and from me by e-mail.  A real version might use a much
stronger PRNG -- maybe one using DES itself (or IDEA) to munch the PRNG
stream.]

DES might have a back door.  It might fall apart when composed (eg., in
triple-DES), based on some still-secret attack.  We don't know.  We do know
that it does a good job of producing random-like output.  So, it's a good
whitener.

The problem is in trying to come up with some other encryption algorithm
(for the middle of the whitening) which can not compose with DES in any
way.  Both of the examples I gave above fail that requirement, I suspect.

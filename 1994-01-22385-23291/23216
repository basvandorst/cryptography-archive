Can anybody tell me what the export laws say concerning the export of
crypto technology, algorithms, etc?

For instance,
1)
under what conditions are these technologies allowed to be exported from
Canada/US?  I am mostly interested in the broadcast television area.

2)
does export restrict hardware, software, or both?

3)
which crypto algorithms can be exported (DES, RSA, Fiat-Shamir, PGP,
Clipper)?

4)
where can crypto be exported too?


5)
who can I talk to get more information?

Thx in Advanced,
Rob

Sorry, but the idea of a one-time pad is that the key is only use one
time, hence the name.  If the key is either repeated within the
message (generally the case in Vigenere) or used for multiple
messages, it is no longer a one-time pad.  Vigenere is not a secure
cipher against a sophisticated opponent.  The cryptanalyis of Vigenere
is has been widely discussed:  Callimahos/Friedman, Gaines, and Sinkov
(cited in section 10.1 of the cryptography FAQ) discuss this.

What you have suggested is possible, but for one, it would be wrong,
as counters have dead times, and for another, it requires some unavailable
data.  There are ways around this.

It would also get messed up if there are even slow changes in digital
response or background noise.  What can be done is to lose a factor
and get considerable robustness.  One samples for a period, and just
uses the parity of the number of counts.  Running this with a moderate
dead time, which really clobbers the Poisson distribution, improves the
uniformity of the parity.  The art of getting good physical random numbers
is to reduce the effect of what can go wrong.

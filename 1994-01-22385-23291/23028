Upgrade paths will vary from one vendor to another.
It is difficult to upgrade firmware that is in a mask rom, for example.

I don't think it's a good idea to require the highest bit rates of
v.fast for a secure phone.  It's important for such a phone to work on
noisy phone lines, such as for international calls.  Anyway, decent
speech coding doesn't require such high bit rates.  The European cell
phone system uses a 13.2kbps coder, while some of your colleagues in
Murray Hill have implemented 4800 bps LD-CELP.  The development
versions of Voice PGP use an 8 kbps switched LPC coder so they can
work with 9600 bps modem connections.  Lower bit rate coders would be
nice to have.

A standard 16450 is good enough, given properly written real-mode
software (i.e. under vanilla MSDOS).  Running something like this
under Unix or Windows without a 16550 could be iffy.

It depends on the card.  The low end cards (e.g. 8-bit Soundblaster)
will have to run half duplex, but some of the fancier ones can do full
duplex, though sometimes only by way of kludges.

It would be nice if such a program supported half duplex communication
using fax modems, which seem more reliable for international calls
than full duplex modems that depend on echo cancellation.  At least,
people exchange faxes all the time with places where getting a reliable
v.32 or v.32bis connection is problematic.

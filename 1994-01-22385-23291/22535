Well, I couldn't resist trying it...

File                     gzip -9v        uc2
----                     --------        ---
html-spec.ps   112.401      4,29s      4.94s
                           39.020     39.092
jstream.exe  2.549.023   1:47,65s    1:15,35
                          948.148    936.058
jargon.txt   1.169.372   1:00,31s    0:41,8s
                          477.053    472.032

and decompressing jargon.txt:
                           16,64s      6,75s

Using UC2 with -TT (maximal compression):

jargon.txt   1.169.372              1:04,43s
                                     460,196

So it looks as though UC2 really *is* better than other compressors and
archivers.  I have to say, though, that I really don't like the
interface at all, and I won't move away from Info-ZIP until there's a
UNIX version.

Still, I give it an 8/10.  I like the fact that it will automatically 
repack zip, arj, arc files into uc2 files.  Certainly worth releasing
Yet Another Compressor; I might actually use this one, unlike ARJ.

Can anyone enlighten me on the legal status of crypto signatures in the UK?
We have a customer who are considering implementing an electronic document
distribution system, and many of their documents (predominently QA related)
require authorisation by signature.  There are significant health and safety
considerations, as some of the documents relate to hazardous machinery.

I'd be interested in any references or other sources.

Many thanks.

David,

I reprint most of your article above, because it illustrates (perhaps
not very purely, but at least concisely) what's wrong with a tactic you
use in argument in a much longer article, below.  It works like this:

	0. State some non-controversial assumptions.

	1. State some  controversial assumptions.

	2. Argue that *if* the assumption in #1 is true then X

	2.5 Include unstated assumption. (not part of the article above --
	    part of another article you wrote, which I critique below)

	3. Argue that *if* the assumption in #1 is true then Y
	   (in fact it may require the unstated assumption in 2.5)

	4. Argue that *if* the assumption in #1 is true then Z

	5. Conclude, on the basis of X, Y, Z, some conclusion C.


The problem is that the assumption in #1 is extremely controversial, 
partly because, say, X, and Y are not widely thought to be true.

The article you respond to above didn't say anything about the
addresses being the basis for the judgments.  In fact, for all you know,
the reference to the addresses were used simply for convenience, or
irony -- one might expect an academic to not know this stuff -- but had
the poster agreed with the academic, he might have said:

	The guy with the .edu address is right, the guy with the .com
	address is wrong.

The problem is that your *assumption* is what's controversial, and you
don't defend it.   Further, you make assumptions along the way, unstated,
which are required to support the conclusion, but likewise are very
controversial.  

Let's examine some of these :

1 & 2 are non-controversial -- at least I see no reason to argue with them.

These are stated assumptions.  Very controversial is the implication
that in assumption 3, the *only significant* motives are to protect our
private sector  interests.  Good heavens!  A major portion of the
argument about the clipper chip is that there's no good reason to trust
the government's stated motives are its real ones -- therefore, really,
if your argument depends on the assumption that the government has no
other motives, and will pursue no other interests, well then, someone
who disagrees with that assumption need read no further.  Why should
they?  If I had written a paper about Viet Nam in 1969  that started
with the assumption that the motive for remaining there was to protect
South Viet Nam (and didn't mention the political difficulty of
withdrawing), then I would have been utterly unable to convince anyone
over the age of fifteen.    Nobody would have troubled to read my paper
further except out of idle curiosity, *or if they agreed with my
assumption*.

And here we have another not-explicitly stated assumption: that the government
would act as you would (or, at least, as you say you would) and this 
would imply that the clipper algorithm  is as strong as NSA can make it.

But you don't defend this assumption.  I attack it thus: assume the
strongest basic algorithm known to NSA is called Q.  Would NSA use Q for the
clipper chip?  No: here's why: the technology for stripping the 
hardware armor off of the clipper chip is likely to advance fairly 
quickly (my assumption).  If Q were on the clipper chip, it could be discovered and
used by an enemy in a few years.  If Q is more vulnerable to attack
if it's understood by the enemy than not (my assumption),  then I've 
delivered my strongest algorithm to my enemies.    This is too great a
menace: therefore I'll use R (a weaker algorithm)  instead for the 
clipper chip.

Perhaps, but we don't give you your assumptions.  Given our assumption
that your assumptions are wrong, it clearly follows that the
rest of your arguments  (however well structured) are worthless; 
anything may follow from a false premise.

Good argumentation normally proceeds from *shared* assumptions to 
controversial conclusions.  You start with controversial assumptions,
assert that *if* your assumptions are right, *then* your conclusion
is right, and then seem bewildered when we disagree.  There's backtracking,
of course -- sometimes the point of an argument turns out to be that
people disagree about assumptions.  By now though, it seems likely
that you know which of yours are controversial.

Here's a big assumption, and unstated: that the *current* state of
the law ("as long as clipper remains voluntary") very strongly influences
its *future* state -- the potential *requirement* of Clipper -- which
is greatly eased if there *is* a Clipper in place.

This is like saying you've no reason to kick on the way to the gallows
*unless* they pull the trapdoor open.  Thank you, no.  I'll resist now,
while it's more effective.

I hope you'll forgive me for making this article so pointed at you,
but it seems to me that it was your method of making controversial
assumptions that led to my disagreement with you.  For example, here's
one that I think we'd almost all agree with:

	The motives of the security establishment are largely hidden from us.

Here's another:

	At times, and for various reasons, governments do things 
	against the interests of their constituencies, despite the good
	intentions of components of those governments.

I suggest that you adjust the header in any response to this note, instead.

I don't mean to be wholly negative here.  For example, if you start
with the assumption that government has reasons to use "R" instead of "Q",
and then show *why* those reasons are insufficient, then you'll be 
proceeding from an assumption we share to one we do not.  I may disagree,
but the argument will start at the same place.

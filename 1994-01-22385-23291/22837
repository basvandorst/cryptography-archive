False dichotomy.  You could compete by producing a better, cheaper
product, rather than by trying to gain a monopoly by locking people in
to a proprietary file format.

Compressors are different.  I can distribute unzip with .zip files, LHA
with .lzh files, gzip with .gz files, HPACK with .hpk files, and so
on.  With every other compressor on the market, I can distribute a
decompressor on the disk (in case the recipient doesn't have one) and a
bunch of compressed files.  With UC2, I can't.  That's a big
disadvantage.

You're not competing with WordPerfect.  You're competing with other
compression programs.  You therefore have to be better than them, not
better than WordPerfect.

So if you're going to publish the file format, what's the point in
trying to stop people from disassembling the program?

Well, there's no easy answer.  However, if you document the file
format, people will be able to build compatible programs and verify
UC2's behaviour that way.

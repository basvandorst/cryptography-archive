I don't think this is a problem, a crypto expert can say whether a
system is soundly based.  However a public key signature system is like
using a rubber stamp to sign checks/cheques.  To hold someone to a
signed document requires 3 core items:
1.  Validation of the signature.  With a public key system this would mean
    cryptographically checking with the public key.  With the rubber stamp
    it would be comparison with another instance of a stamped article.
2.  Association of the signature with the person you believe made it.
3.  Overcome the defence that the signatory lost control of the device
    (ie private key, or stamper) at the time the document was signed.

A somewhat different situation, presumably the cryptographic evidence
was one item amongst several.

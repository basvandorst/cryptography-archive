As far as I know Ian Flemming made a plan of stealing one of the enigma's
and the codebooks of a submarine enigma (had one rotor extra)... the plan 
succeeded ... they captured a submarine which surfaced because of severe
damage caused by deep-sea-bombs ... while the submarine was sinking they
removed the enigma and the codebooks ... a few english soldiers and the
commanding officer drowned when the submarine sank...

The english tryed to steal an enigma from a poor armed weather-ship too, 
they captured the enigma but the codebooks where desstroyed... by the
crew of the wether-ship.

...this information is as a remember it ... if somebody is interested i can
look it up... and give more precise information..

I don't know of a public domain version but AccessData has a program
that will recover WordPerfect 6.0 passwords.  From what I have heard,
WordPerfect made a considerable effort enhancing their encryption
feature for 6.0 but apparently it did not help much.  AccessData's
WRPASS for WordPerfect 6.0 recovers passwords fairly quickly (a few
minutes or less on i486).

For more information about AccessData's password recovery products
call 800-574-5199 or 801-224-6980.

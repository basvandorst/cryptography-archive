Moore's law is the well known law that digital chip complexity
increases by a factor of 2 in every X years.

Now in cryptanalytic terms, we have a similar measure of complexity; maximum
breakable key length. Obviously this depends on the algorithm used, and how
much effort you can expend to break something, but the length of a key that
can be broken obviously increases as the technology does.

Has anyone studied this length in terms of a "Moore's Law" ? Is there a
similar rate of doubling ?

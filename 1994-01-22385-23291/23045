Yes, the amount of computation is very impressive.  However, I don't
think it's a record if you count things like phased-array radar
systems (used for looking over the horizon for incoming missiles).
These do massive numbers of signal processing operations and operate
for years... I think synthetic aperture radars used on military
airplanes effectively crunch even more numbers, using optical
analog computers of some kind... I wonder if such techniques could
ever be applied to this kind of discrete computation.

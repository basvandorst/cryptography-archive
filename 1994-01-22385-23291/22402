This is certainly interesting.  I have never been a great fan of
public key systems over conventional encipherment.  Public key systems
depend upon making known an algorithm for computing a permutation and
hoping that an attacker is not able to evaluate the inverse of that
permutation at selected points.  Even in the general case, this is not
obviously an intractible math problem. We can all remember the
knapsack algorithm crashing in flames a few years back.

Although factoring is believed to be hard, and factoring breaks RSA,
breaking RSA does not simplify factoring.  Trivial non-factoring
methods of breaking RSA could therefore exist.  Whether this paper is
legitimate remains to be seen, but it is certainly not beyond the
realm of possiblity.

#   Public key, also known as Rivest, Shamir, and Adelman,
#   cryptography is broken without factoring the modulus m.
#   The product of the encryption and the decryption exponent is
#   computed directly with order log(base 2) m shifts, adds, and compares.
#   A continued product between the modulus and its multiplier which
#   matches a criterion solves the Fermat-Euler theorems simply for
#   even very large moduli.

This doesn't tell us a lot.  On the plus side, it is a non-factoring
algorithm which sounds plausible.  On the minus side, it sounds a tad
mumbo-jumbo-esque.  I would expect a legitimate non-factoring approach
to invert the permutation used for encipherment without explicit
calculation of the private key, which would trivially lead to
factorization of the modulus.

As a friend of mine used to say - "There are no trapdoor functions,
only bad algorithms for evaluating their inverses." :)

This does seem to be the major fly in the ointment here.  Unless
we are prepared to believe that Payne has also solved the
factoring problem, or we are grossly misreading his abstract, its
claims do not seem credible.  The part about the solution being
of operational complexity Log2(m) seems a bit unbelievable as
well.  I would expect a more complex formula.

I would tend to agree.

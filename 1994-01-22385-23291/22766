Er, not quite. Note the '-'. Ben-XXX means Son-of-XXX in Hebrew. However it is
a separate word. In Hebrew you can write it either with or without the '-'; I
make sure in English to provide the '-' to avoid this middle/nick-name
problem. As to why the last name is first... Same reason you put the month
before the day, I suppose :-)

Its nice of the government to give you a tool to keep your secrets safe from
foreigners. Now, Israel is much more concerned about its internal and external
security then the USA or France or almost any other country I can think of.
Yet, as an Israeli citizen I don't need to apply for permission to use strong
crypto. I can use it whenever I damn wish, e.g. PGP (legally! software patents
do not hold here!). I can also freely export it, import it, publish it, etc.

As for assurances, I took a one-year course in cryptology by Shamir (the 'S'
in RSA; he and Biham have finalized their DES work that year, so we could
track it `in real time'. FUN!). Not that it makes me an expert, but his
assurance is good enough for me. There are also all these books in the
library. I don't need the NSA.

Given escrow the question is whether you trust the _government_ not to spy on
you. It seems you trust it 100% not to do so except for the legal way -
through court orders etc. This is the point where other people trust it only
<100%, since this issue rests on government _promises_. Likewise, the question
of voluntary use rests on government _promises_.

You claim this promises are genuine. The government really really intends to
keep them. Let us believe for a moment this is so. What about the next
government? And the next one after that? Most people would agree that in fact,
the reliability of government promises is <100% due to at least this reason.
In fact government ignore promises routinely, which makes the trust level
<<100%.

Once we agree that the reliability of the promises is <100%, the matter of
capabilities comes up. And once this issue rises Clipper seems like a Very Bad
Thing.

I note you didn't answer my questions... Do you think implanting government
locators in people is a good idea, yes or no, and if no, how come using
Clipper is a good one?

Such a company, I would expect, would operate under secrecy requirements
similar to those applying to banks. So if they abuse the data they will end up
in jail, not merely out of business.

I personally would not install such a device in my car unless it was operating
_only_ when the car is stolen or when I push a button (to call the service or
whatever). I heard of similar devices that are used to automate road toll
collection, and again I would not install such a thing in my car unless I
could disable it (i.e., choose to pay manually). From your description I would
say that this device does not satisfy these requirements.

This does not mean that such a device has no use. For example, it is legal for
a _company_ to track the location of its car pool. This alone would give it a
large market (taxi companies, trucking companies, police, ...) Likewise it is
legal for a company to listen in on phone conversations made through phone
lines _it owns_ (e.g., to insure quality of phone-based tech-support). The
point is, there is a severe legal limit on such practices. The rights of
employees to privacy is recognized by law and does not allow such practices to
be unlimited in scope.

You could argue that just as the law limits the company's abuse of its power,
the law would limit the government's abuse of its power. The difference is, of
course, that its the government that enforces the law. So in the second case
we get a conflict of interests - the government is supposed to enforce a law
that limits the government. It boils down to a question of trust - do you
trust in 100% that the government will limit _itself_ to legal practices? It
seems you do, and obviously most other people do not. In particular, the
founders of the USA did not. Past experience indicates that governments do, in
fact, break the law. So I don't see what you base your trust on.

   I'm looking for a copy of PGP for Unix, and, perhaps, some help in getting
   it set up (I'm still pretty new to Unix).

   Direction to an FTP site that has it and that I could access would be
   appreciated.

There are many such.  One that I know is accessible, because I administer
it is black.ox.ac.uk (129.67.1.165).

Use the login name "anonymous" and the password equal to your email
address, "n9348795@gonzo.cc.wwu.edu" in this instance.

Then, change to the appropriate directory with "cd src/security",
change to binary transfer mode and get the file pgp23A.tar.Z into an
appropriate directory on your machine.

Uncompress it and untar it, then follow instructions in the README
file.

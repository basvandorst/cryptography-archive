Yes, it is on the DIS list of approved products.  Or at least "was" from
the last time I saw it.  We obtained the list directly from three 
separate DIS representatives and they ALL had the Sun format command as
an approved method.  We ran an experiment on a 1.2 gigabyte hard disk and 
found that about about 1 megabyte of data was still left on the disk.
We were surprised it was approved for declassifying hard disks.

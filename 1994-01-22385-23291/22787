  The SCSI Format command is not required by the spec to do anything
at all to the medium.  Even on drives where it writes a specific
pattern, this is not good enough for secure applications, where each
block of the device must be written with a number of different
patterns to erase residual magnetism.

  "Alternate cylinders" are the space typically reserved on a SCSI disk
for bad sectors.  Suppose that you store secret information on your disk.
One day you are reading it, and you get an error.  The operating system
tries again, manages to read the data, reallocates it to another logical
block, and writes it back out there.

  The original block is no longer accessible through normal SCSI commands
at that point, and the secret data on it can't be erased without doing
some tricks (like reformatting the device with alternate cylinders/tracks/
sectors disabled, and then zapping all sectors).

  I'm willing to believe there are other vendors for similar software,
but it's not something done "all the time".

To the contrary, I know all about that stuff, and even more that you've left
out. But I also believe in progress, and that governments are improvable
under the design of our Constitutional, tri-partite system.

Let me give you a simple example. Some years ago there was a lot of concern
about accidental or malicious launch of nuclear weapons. I worked in the
private sector for a distinguished former senior sub-cabinet Defense
official (I'm being a bit vague to protect his identity) who had been
involved in the system. He told me (this was many years ago) that the
problem the government was worried about was that they couldn't launch when
they were supposed to, not that they'd launch when they weren't. He was
making a technical statement about the built-in safeguards.

Just so, given all the scandals of the past (and most were exposed and
corrected by the government itself--how does that gybe with your demon
theory?), there are extensive legal and oversight safeguards that didn't
exist in those days, such that until recently the problem was that some
national security organizations actually couldn't do the job Congress
expected of them. The pendulum finally swung a little of the way back, and
Congress reduced its level of paranoia (I don't say it was unjustified on
the historical record) a bit. But we are a long way from agencies out of
control today, and the evidence of the current administration is that they
continue to clean house (their exposure of and behavior toward the radiation
tests being but one example).

What I have been trying to poke at is the definition of "best". For some
type of Monte Carlo simulation of real processes, it is clear that
best should mean a good aproximation of an uniform distribution. However,
it isn't clear to me this is the case for strong crypto.

For example, suppose I had a function which generated sequences of numbers
indistinguishable from an random uniform distribution and then took the
natural logrithm of them. The resulting distribution would not be uniform,
but it would still be unpredicatable. Admittedly, this is a contrived example
in that if I had as good of random number generator as I propose I wouldn't
need to process the output further. However, I would think an XOR from either
the original stream or the processed stream would be equally strong for
encryption purposes.

Maybe the focus on uniform distributions and tests such as chi square are
needed more for the ease of computation rather than some inherent need.
At least it seems obvious to me measuring the goodness of a random number
generator using chi squre is much simpler than specifying some sort of
correlation measure as I suggested in my earlier post.

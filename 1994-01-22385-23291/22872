No, it's a counterexample.  You made the assertion that
"One may not pick and choose".  Clearly one does pick and choose when one
believes that essential freedoms are at stake, whether this is in the
commercial or personal venue.  

Your attempt to avoid addressing this matter by claiming I'm trying to
start a flame war is obfuscatory.  Answer the point, please: in 
our society and others, people have had to break or bend the law to defend 
their freedoms.  Civil disobedience is part of this tradition, but not 
all of it.  

Your apparent attempt to avoid discussing this matter is consistent: 
you seem to dislike any thread that undermines the government's
legitimacy, without being shrill.

Why do I hear, "Just wait 'til your father gets home" in the tone of this.

To whom are you referring?

Ah, argument by salami-slicing:

	Recap:

	A: X
	B: X isn't true (counterexample).
	A: Okay, 0.9x is true
	
	Still to come?

	B: Nope, 0.9x isn't true (counterexample)
	A: Okay, 0.81x is true

And the near-end-game:

	DS: Okay, left-handed Latvian dwarves, with no connection to the 
	house of Hapsburg, may not pick and choose

	NH: But what about... (hypothetical counterexample)

	DS Okay, left-handed latvian dwarves with connections to *neither*
	the house of Hapsburg, NOR the families of those folks who watched
	"Roots" during the Rodney King riots may choose.
	
and so on.

C'mon, David: either "one can pick and choose", or one can't.  
Did Rosie Parks (or Dr. King) have to go to the back of the bus or not?

Let's not make it so I have to provide counterexamples for every
single possible entity that might disobey a government decree of every
possible type.

>As for the rest, see the matter following "EXCEPT".

An inadequate answer, I think.

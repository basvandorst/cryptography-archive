As most readers know by now, Brendan Kehoe, author of
ZEN AND THE ART OF THE INTERNET, was seriously injured in a
car crash on 31 December. Brendan's wit and helpfulness earned
him many friends.  The Cu Digest editors are encouraging netfolk
to send electronic messages to him that include a joke, funny
story, or a "get-well" recipe.  The editors will accecpt e-mail
contributions until about January 19. Then, we'll print the
responses on rag-bond paper, bind them, and send them to him as
a "net anthology."

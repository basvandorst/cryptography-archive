This is completely wrong! You are mixing two completely different
cipher machines. The Geheimschreiber is an on-line teleprinter
cipher machine. If we are using Geheimscreiber as the generic term
for these machines there existed at least two different types,
the Siemens T52 A/B, C, D, and E (Schlusselfernschreibmachine) machines
and the Lorenz SZ40 and SZ42 (Schlusselzusatz) machines. 

The Bombes were key finding machines used to find the keys used with
the Enigma machine. Colossus was used to find the wheel settings of
the Lorenz SZ40/SZ42 machines. It was not used for Enigma.

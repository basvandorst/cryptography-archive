Try the Presidential Library for the president under which it was
issued.  If it's classified, you can ask them to declassify it; it's
a routine process in many cases.

I recently got a copy of NSAM #160, dealing with requirements for
permissive action links on weapons systems, just by asking the JFK
library to initiate a declassification review.

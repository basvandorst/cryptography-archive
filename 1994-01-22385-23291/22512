One of the local cable TV companies here ran a free T-shirt
offer during the broadcast of an expensive pay-per-view
boxing match.  They ran a commercial that offered a free 
Las Vegas T-shirt -- just call and give your name and address.
They ran it encrypted so that those who paid for the fight
could not see it and only those with pirate decoder boxes
saw it.  Then, with name and address, they investigated
every person who called in.

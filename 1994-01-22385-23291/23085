NSA didn't reveal the S-box criteria because they don't want to teach
others -- any others, whether civilian-sector researchers or foreign
cryptographic organizations -- about something they may not know already.

And they didn't weaken DES because they really did want a certain measure
of strength -- they had to assume that at least some other countries
knew about differential cryptanalysis.

In other words, it looks from here as if they told the literal truth
about their goals and about whether or not DES had been weakened --
and most folks didn't believe them.

The last company I worked for was involved in black programs.  We had only
one certified tape degausser in the whole company (with individual projects
spending $1B+/yr.)  For disposal of tapes, we had to physically destroy them
if they were leaving our project's control.  Hard disk erasure required a
minimum of 7 erasure passes with an approved (by that agency) pattern or they
were not considered clean.  And we didn't have the most oppressive security
on site.

How many different versions of CDROMs do you think major UNIX houses build?
(Hint: in general, you're wrong.)

If that reasoning were valid, then the supposed profits to be made for
the last 20 years by producing good-crypto domestic products as well as
exportable products would have had many vendors producing two products.
Instead, the historical fact is that while most (all?) major system vendors
get a large fraction, sometimes most of their revenue from exports, they
have almost all produced a single version of their software, complete with
American English messages and crippled cryptographic facilities.
I guess they've all been too "greedy".

Simply turning the crank to produce a new UNIX binary release, with no
changes to the source except in the release numbers costs even the smaller
vendors several $100,000.  The precise places where the money goes is no
doubt as much a secret as the costs on the bills of material for the
hardware, but if you have ever seen a real, commercial release cycle,
they're obvious.  Those are the manufacturing costs of a release, not
its distribution or support costs, which are often much larger.

When the desired things happen, it's "the profit motive."  When economic
facts reduce wishful thinking to silliness, it's "greed."  That sounds more
like a political, not an economic argument.

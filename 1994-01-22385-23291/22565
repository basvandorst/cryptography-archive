Hi Folks,

Sometime back I was asking about any industry std. for encryption
APIs (not Public Key cryptos but just plain old encryption - thanx
anyway Kurt@RSA.com) - sort of a superset of all encryption support 
services may be put together as a state machine.

A related question - 
	Are there any std.s to be followed for enhancing 
	SQL servers/clients to include encryption of selected
	fields in querries or data responses.

Will appreciate any email responses.

Thanx in advance - Happy New Year - Srini

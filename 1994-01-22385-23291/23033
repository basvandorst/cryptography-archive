Well if you send the hash over a secure encrypted channel, you
don't have to worry about active eavesdropping either.  Setting
up the channel is difficult, however.

I think you don't want to read encrypted incoming mail on the unix
system.  If you don't trust the security of the unix system, then any
message you read on it should immediately be considered compromised.
And if you don't mind it being compromised, why are you so worried
about how you pass decryption keys around?  Conclusion: read
confidential mail *only* on your PC.  Some software to make this
easier would be nice, of course.

Re active eavesdropping: If you trust the hardware of the Unix system
and are concerned about active eavesdropping only between your modem
and the Unix system's, you may be able to detect the eavesdropping by
carefully monitoring the round trip latency of pinging characters from
your PC to the Unix system and having the Unix system send them back.
Current v32bis modems have quite a long latency (like >50 ms).  Adding
another pair would slow things down a noticable amount.  V.34 is
likely to be even worse. You would only have to do this careful timing
during an initial key exchange operation; after that, you'd have a
secure channel you could use without worrying about eavesdroppers.  Of
course, the active eavesdropper could be on the other side of the
remote modem...

Nothing is going to prove it because it is not impossible.  It's only a
matter of how much cpu power you have, and how long you want to wait. 
What would be nice would be some sort of authoritative study of just how
difficult it is.  If it's equivalent to cracking 1024 bit RSA keys, I
wouldn't be too worried.  If it's equivalent to brute-forcing a DES key,
then some people probably should be worried.

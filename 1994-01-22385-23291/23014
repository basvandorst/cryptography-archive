Very small exponents together with very small messages are obviously
not safe:

E=3
encrypted message: 27

Guess what the plain text is? (hint: what's the cube root of 27)

I would assume that all practical RSA programs pad out the message
with (I would hope random bits) upto the full length...

If you know exactly how many times the modulo has been exceeded, then
you can calculate the last digits of the message raised to the
exponent. From that you can calculate your plaintext. I think that
this is more likely to work the smaller the exponent is.

I think for an exponent of 17 the number of ways that the exponent can
be exceeded is only 131K, if you know the length in bits of the frame
used, or you can guess it. It goes roughly 2^E, so you need E > 40 or
so to ensure even reasonable security.

Provided E > 100 you should have good security, provided your plain
text isn't a single byte... but that is where we came in.

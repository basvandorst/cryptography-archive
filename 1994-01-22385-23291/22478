(1) It's not.  (2) It's dead simple to break.

That's yet another implementation of what's called the Vigenere cipher,
touted as recently as 1917 by Scientific American as "impossible of
translation".  The irony is that it's a brain-damaged version of Blaise de
Vigenere's -real- cipher, which was considerably stronger, using mixed
alphabets instead of straight ones, which leave the frequency statistics
in alphabetical order.  (See Kahn's "The Codebreakers", pp. 145ff.)

It's easy to break with ciphertext only on a text only a few times as long
as the key: the spaces in the text are a dead giveaway after you've found
the key length with index of coincidence.

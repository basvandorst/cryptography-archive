Since hard disk crashes are unlikely to happen frequently, why could not they
store the only "extra" copies of the salt elsewhere [e.g. in the US].  Should
their hard disk crash, they could ask the US to resend it over some secure
channel.  The only problems would be:
 -1- Possible denial-of-service attack if communications are blocked when
     the hard disk crashes.
 -2- One would need to ensure that the US did not send the key to "enemy"
     parties, and was not tricked into sending the salt after the embassy
     deliberately destroyed it.

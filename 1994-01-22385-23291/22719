As someone who has interacted with Tim on a couple electronic fora,
let me put it this way: I respect Tim's opinion on a wide variety
of topics, some related to the proper application of cryptography,
and will sometimes seek out his beliefs on a proper course of action
before I go ahead and do what I was going to beforehand, in complete
disregard for his opinion.

That doesn't mean I don't value his opinion.

Are you such an authoritarian that you can't understand this?

Once an income tax above 5% was seen as something that only a crazy
radical would propose. Sounds to me like a nice state of affairs to
restore.

And as for black markets, unemployed Russians are clamoring for a
return to some form of fascism at the same time that Russian
manufactured high technology is subject to egrerious restrictions for
importation into the United States that are equivalent to tariffs or
price supports for our higher-priced products.

I used to dislike the idea of black markets. Now I don't know.

I'm just spelunking in this group. If you follow-up, please cc:
the response to me via email.

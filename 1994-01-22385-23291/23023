   One solution that comes to mind is to make the product in Mexico, or
   Japan, or Europe, or anywhere except the US.  Then you can put in DES,
   or any other crypto you feel like and export it wherever you want.

The government claims that it's not legal to export crypto hardware or
software without specific licenses from them, but it *is* legal to
import crypto software (though maybe not hardware.)
If you were doing a pure software product, I'd recommend hiring a
non-US assistant to add in DES code (available PD in Finland, etc.)
to the rest of your product, and then shipping it back to you for the
US versions.  With firmware, it's several levels more annoying,
because they'll have to compile it, make sure it fits, burn the PROMs, etc.

About what you'd expect from governments....

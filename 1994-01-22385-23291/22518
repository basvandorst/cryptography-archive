Paraphrased from:
"Briefs California (Jan 3 3 pm PST) - clari.local.california.briefs #2428"

A truck driver with 31 years experience had his "interstate
[drivers] license" revoked because of federal regulations 
defining a minimum level of eye-sight in each eye. The
bullshit is that this man lost an eye as a child. He 
NEVER had sight in one eye while performing 31 years of driving,
now he is not allowed because of the federal control
of interstate traffic. 

Experience is orders of magnatude more important to good 
driving than having two eyes as opposed to one.

As a (nearly) one-eyed person I can say that this crock of shit 
is a perfect example of the arbitrary rulings that get
passed by people inside the beltway for "our own good".
It doesn't effect them, no.........

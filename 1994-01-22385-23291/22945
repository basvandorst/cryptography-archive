I'm not sure if this is the cipher you're referring to, but three
years ago I was working at the Australian Defence Force Academy
developing a 64-bit block cipher. The name of the cipher is LOKI.

There are two variants - LOKI'89 and LOKI'91 - the latter a redesign
due to the original being broken. We were looking at getting
government certification, but I don't know what happened, since I
left at the end of '91.

The algorithm encrypts 64-bit plaintexts with a 64-bit key. It has
been immunized to differential cryptanalysis and assorted key schedule
attacks. The structure is DES-like, using 16 rounds also, but the
S-boxes are much bigger (4 x 12 bit x 8 bit tables). The key schedule
is much simpler than DES (a weakness in LOKI'89), which makes it much
faster to implement in software.

For more information, try contacting Lawrie Brown - last I heard
his address was lpb@csadfa.cs.adfa.oz.au

Well, that certainly clears it up for me. The argument is the same one used
by those who think the government shouldn't have weapons, much less nukes;
shouldn't have an IRS audit division; shouldn't have an FBI; shouldn't
require economic reports from business; shouldn't have an SEC, etc. etc.
because all such things might be abused some day, and probably have in the
past.

If I knew that was the fundamental assumption of some who were responding to
my discussions, I wouldn't have bothered to enter into colloquy with them,
since our fundamental assumptions preclude any progress in such a
discussion.

Thanks for posting this. Better late than never.

Best;
David

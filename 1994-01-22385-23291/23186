Now you're confusing me....  that's what I thought you meant originally,
and then you said that *wasn't* what you meant (I'm very confused... can
you tell?  :-) ).   Let me say the following as a statement that I
*think* applies to what you are claiming.  If it doesn't, just ignore me!

With signatures based on public key cryptography, there is *nothing* that
the secret key buys you that the public key doesn't.  In other words,
there is no reason to *ever* reveal the private key, whether the signature
has been challenged or not.  A certified public key does exactly the
same job.  Or if you are going to ask (or subpeona) the user for a key, and 
trust their honesty, just ask for their public key --- there is no amount
of verification you can get with the private key that you can't get
with the public key instead.

   The CD-ROM you mention has all the play-for-pay programs encryptded
   with the same secret key; if one recipient of the secret key decides
   to cheat, all security is lost.  It depends for its success on the
   honest of the people who buy the software -- it assumes they have an
   incentive to keep the key secret because they paid a lot of money for it.

Are you talking about Sun or Apple?  Other companies have done this,
and it's got the potential to be a very effective method of software
distribution.  The demo disk Hugh Daniel did at a startup company he
worked for had a friendly windowing navigation program (unlike Sun's),
vendors' demo versions of their software, and encrypted distributions;
once you decided you like something, you call up with a credit card number,
they give you the key, and you're in business.

A previous poster said Apple was using some sort of wimpy encryption.
(Sun can be expected to know better, and at least use DES :-)  
If I were doing one of these, I'd use a separate key for each program,
and on Suns, which have built-in serial numbers, I'd use a decryption
method that depended on the serial number to get the real key.
Somebody who wanted to could still grab the key as it went by
if they really wanted to, but they could just as easily steal the
decrypted files after they're installed. 

An alternative technology people use is to use a floating license
manager program, which lets you simply ship the real unencrypted code
on the CD so it doesn't matter if people copy it.  Those typically use
crypto hashes of the serial number or whatever.

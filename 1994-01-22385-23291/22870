  Actually there is a "Sneakers" like method that is capable of breaking
  all encryption but, for it to work you need to build and operate a time 
  machine.  Not trivial but theoreticly possible.  (And not the proposed
  method of the Movie.)

  (1)
  The mechanics of the method give you an infinite amount of time to 
  calculate/solve the cryptogram and report back the answer a moment
  after you requested it.

  (2)
  |Or| You could view this decryption method as a Wheeler many 
  universes collapse where you guess the key and it turns out to be the 
  correct one because of the time machine.  (Also good for selecting 
  tonights winning lotto numbers. :-) ) 

  i.e. You actually need to guess the key -completely- randomly thus
  theoreticly creating enough separate universes to populate the
  key space and then use a time machine to send "back" the correct 
  answer. 

  Too bad congress canceled the SCSC.  ;-) (- Physics research -)

  Not that I could tell. It might be some real prank theorem though
  that proves everything by dividing by zero someplace.

  I've cross posted this to rec.arts.sf.science where it is probably 
  more appropriate.

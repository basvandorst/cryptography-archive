RELEASED: UltraCompressor II

AIP-NL (a company located in The Netherlands) has released a
datacompressing archiver: UltraCompressor II (UC). This archiver uses
completely new archiving and compression technology developed by AIP-NL
with help of the University of Utrecht. AIP-NL claims UC compresses
10%-50% better than competing software yet at the same time can update
archives up to 10 times faster.

Furthermore UC features full OS/2 2.x extended attribute support, the
ability to keep multiple versions of files, multimedia banners,
triple-DES encryption (separate tool) and digital signature based
authenticity verification (separate tool). Also UC archives can be made
"damage protected" which makes them resistant against a limited amount
of bad sectors.

UC is "try before you buy" software, allowing you to verify our claims.
The UC package is available through FTP at "ftp.NL.net" in the directory
"gopher/NLnet-connected/AIP-NL". This directory also contains a seperate
textfile describing UC in more detail. Documentation describing how UC
achieves its high compression ratio is included in the UC package.

If you have any questions or want to get the detailed information or the
package in a different way (e.g. by uuencoded email), please contact
AIP-NL (the addresses are at the bottom).

Take care,

     Nico de Vries.

Along those lines, you might want to look at ``Design of the Commercial
Data Masking Facility (CDMF) Data Privacy Algorithm'', Don Johnson,
Stephen Matyas, An Le and John Wilkins, Proceedings of the First ACM
Conference on Computer and Communications Security, Fairfax, VA  Nov
1993.  It describes a 40-bit DES that is nevertheless as strong as DES
against anyone who can't crack DES.  (Caution:  it's somewhere between
possible and likely that IBM has filed for a patent on this.  They're
a company that's very active in patenting stuff like that, including,
I might add, DES itself (though that patent has expired).)

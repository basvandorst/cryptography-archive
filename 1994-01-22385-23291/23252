In what way inconsistent?  Enigma was used to encipher signals sent by
morse.  The Lorenz SZ40 & SZ42 were used to encipher Teleprint messages,
ie BAUDOT code to/from a teletype with punched tape, keyboard & print
unit.  Although it does sound a little exaggerated, computing time on the
Colossus was very valuable - when the wheel setting were found for a
message the decryption was performed with a 'tunny', allowing the Colossus
to be used on another message.

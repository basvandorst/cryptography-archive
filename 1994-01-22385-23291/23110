Indeed, even chosen-plaintext attacks (where the attacker picks the
plaintext, which is the hardest attack for a cryptosystem to
withstand) were used to good effect at least once by American
cryptanalysts during World War II (shortly before the battle of
Midway; it was used to confirm that Midway was, in fact, the target of
the attack).

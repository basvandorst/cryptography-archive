I heard about that, too.  But *INVESTIGATING* is different than immediately
arresting anyone who called.  All it proves is that you WATCHED the fight,
or got the info from someone who did.  It doesn't prove that you OWNED or
USED the bogus box.  Unless they bluffed you into confessing or granting
permission to search your home, they'd still need to investigate further.
That would probably mean either obtaining a search warrant or using some
sophistocated electronics to detect the presence of an unauthorized box on
your line.

BTW, was it an 800 number they used, so that they could use ANI to identify
the number you called from?  That would be effective if they said you had to
call within the next three minutes, or something.  They'd be reasonably
certain that the call originated from the site of the illegal decoder.  (How
many Americans even know that when you call an 800 number, the person on the
other end may instantly know YOUR phone number?  It's a different system
than the controversial "Caller ID", BTW.)

From the preceeding discussion, where fair sized fragments may be
unacceptable, it seems the only answer is a highly brisant explosive,
such as C4 (or some similar RDX-based composition) surround the item,
in sufficient quantity that the impinging pressure wave would either
vaporize or break the components into such small pieces it wouldn't
matter.

Unfortunately, that means nobody would want to be in the same room when
destruction is initiated.  The drives in such an environment would need
to be in a place for the purpose, and cables outside to where the people
are, so hitting the destruct switch wouldn't be an act of suicide.  It
would need to be tested and somehow standardized to ensure desired
results, not just splat a gob of C4 around the drives, stick a cap into
it and let fly.

That was an interesting anecdote of thermite just dribbling through
the papers, leaving papers with some holes in them.  And I bet that
is exactly what would happen, thinking on it.  While it is very hot,
it doesn't raise the WHOLE INTERIOR of a cabinet enough to result
in reducing the paper to carbon.  Even if it 'welds a howitzer'.
The weapon is rendered useless, but it isn't totally destroyed as
a recognizable entity.

But it is definitely something that needs to be done, and I am amazed
that the suggestion is implied that this hasn't been addressed beforehand.

Just my thoughts, of course.

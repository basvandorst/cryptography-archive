   Is it still too early to project a semi-accurate date (ie-month) as to when
   the major players (USR,Hayes,etc) will have v.34 modems available?

I gather V.34 is the new name for V.FAST?  I'm less interested in when
the official standard modems will be out (and cheap) than whether the
28.8 kb/s V.FC modems available today will be able to interoperate with them,
either  because of upgrades to the old V.FCs or compatibility firmware
in the V.34.  Are the differences small enough that a firmware upgrade
will do, or will people have incompatible Rockwell-chip V.FCs for a while?

The reason I'm crossposting to sci.crypt is that a number of vendors
have recently released non-V.FAST 28.8 kbps modems, which is fast
enough to *easily* support secure voice applications, using voice
coding to either 16kbps or 24kbps.  

How reliable are PCs at receiving data at this speed, assuming that
the CPU will be heavily loaded doing voice coding (if you don't have a
Sound card) or moderately loaded doing bit-moving and encryption (if you do)?
Is it enough to need a 16550 uart, or are the lower-end chips good enough?
Can sound cards do simultaneous encoding and decoding, or will we have
to use half-duplex communications with some variant on push-to-talk or VOX?

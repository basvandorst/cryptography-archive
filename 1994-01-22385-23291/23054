In the UK, this is impossible. You can't use computer evidence unless the 
machine's owner signs a certificate saying that it was working; and you can't 
force a suspect to incriminate himself by signing one.

So all I have to do is refuse to certify my machine and there's no way you can 
link me to my secret key any more.

 What this hash will prove, essentially, that the digital content of
 photo was made available to the camera circuit somehow. This is far cry
 from proving that image was produced by this camera - I can imagine
 one could cut encypted hash from given image, re-create it with his
 own key and claim photo's his. what this system _is_ useful for, is
 make it impossible to disclaim that you claimed certain image as yours.
 That might be useful, too, of course.

 This doesn't need any bild-in circuitry, of course. Ordinary PC would do
  the job all right.

No typo, just nonsense. If not nonsense, *name them*.

No, you do. You pay for it.

David, you are clearly reading a Constitution I have never seen, probably
the NSA's copy. The Constitution speaks of a militia, and an army, and
civil defense, and privacy. It says nothing about granting the government
keys to our houses or keys to our communications.

See above on who demands this.

So you want the government to develop their own dope to sell in high
schools, because it will be "safer" dope, and outlaw all other forms
of dope. Sounds silly as hell to me...

Great, so self-interest is an illegal challenge. Tell it to John Gilmore
and Sun computers.

How can anyone know its different without peer review: I repeat, it's
security through obscurity. If they're going to develop secure
communications on an international digital level, we may as well sell
them the chips to do it and make some money on the deal, and protect US
companies oversees.

How the hell do any of us know? Based on the wiretapping example, and
their policy of utter secrecy, who can know the NSA's plans? Or have
they been sending you notes they're not publishing anywhere else?

First, I was not aware of any promise to preserve it as voluntary,
and second, a subtle government promise not founded in case law or
constitutional law is hardly evidence.

Man, you must work for the NSA on the side. Who employs you is a
primary motive for human politics and attitudes, and hardly a trivial
issue in these matters. It's a motive that you may deny, but I have
never heard of you addressing.

Mind you, you're usually in my kill file....

     1) This posting was by someone who believes he knows a lot more
about cryptography than he does.

     2) If Bill Payne's algorthm worked, but was not ready for
publication, all he would have to do is to post part of the solution
to Rivest's challenge to get a lot of very favorable attention.

     3) If I understand the "method" correctly, it works may take a
long time...  In other words it may not be as fast as other known
factoring methods which chase RSA into the 512-bit range for security.

     4) However, this is not necessarily a reflection on the novelty
of the idea, which seems to be a faster algorithm for doing modular
exponentiation.  So my intent is to find and read the paper (when
available) for the ideas on implementation of multi-precision
arithmetic, but not because I think it beats RSA.

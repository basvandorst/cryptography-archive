Not directly.  There's nothing in the memo that  could not be done with
conventional systems, although public key certainly does provide
an improved basis for building permissive links (since you could
reverse-engineer a link and never learn the go code).  There is a small
bit about "legal and political control requirements" that could be
the requirement that those who have to act upon messages must not
be able to forge them, but that isn't spelled out (at least in
the unclassified parts of the memo).

It's an interesting memo, and gives some insight into the relationship
between cryptography (and technology in general) and the military
in the cold-war era.  But there's no "smoking gun" dealing directly
with PK, or if there is, it's too subtle for my eyes.

I've been intending to type it in and post it (the memo itslef is short
but the attached memo with all the details is 5 pages long).  I'll
try to get to it somtime in the next week or so.

A. Ferrenberg, D. Landau, and Y. Wong showed that some of the most
used pseudo-random number generators, used in Monte Carlo simulation, have
some built in bias. One of them was subtract-and-carry sequence.

What is the implication of their findings for pseudo-random number
generators used in cryptology ? Are pseudo-random number generators
used in cryptology much better than the ones used in Monte Carlo
simulation ? (Yes, I am trying to contact them.)

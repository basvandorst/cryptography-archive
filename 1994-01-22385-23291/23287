 I've read "Codebreakers" and don't recall cases when the (_exact_ plaintext)/
 cyphertext pairs were available, much less encrypted with the same key
 Care to name them ?

 You don't know exact plaintext even if you know all of the above. 
 Bank may use codebook for those, for instance. further, you may not
 be sure that the key is the same every time. I remain unconvinced.

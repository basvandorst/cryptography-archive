Please note that this isn't really compression, but if you're looking for 
something that is _almost_ guaranteed to be unique, you could consider a CRC 
of the string.  A 64-bit (8 byte) CRC should have a pretty low probability of 
being duplicated, especially for a 60-character string.

Also, Carlos doesn't say whether the original string needs to be reconstructed 
(at least he doesn't in the quoted portion of his message; maybe he did in his 
original posting.)  Are there any methods of performing one-way encryption 
(other than CRC :-)?

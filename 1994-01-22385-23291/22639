Thank you for clarifying your earlier rather imprecise language.

However, there is no evidence in the hearings or legislation of the 1970s
that reflected Congresssional paranoia. Nor is there evidence that the
intelligence community was nearly crippled by Congressional oversight
or restrictions on surveillance. The bulk of the focus was on
law enforcement activity. Although there were significant restrictions 
placed on federal intelligence agencies, there is no evidence that
these restrictions significantly hindered the legitimate activities of
the CIA or FBI.

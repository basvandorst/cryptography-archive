Thats an interesting point. When I asked it a year or so ago, the response
from CD-ROM pressers was that it wasn't possible (ie. they didn't want to do
it) and it would certainly cost more than distributing a separate
uniquely-numbered dongle. I was looking at supplying high-value commercial
information in runs of around 500, updated monthly/quarterly.

Now that more and more CD-ROM pressing (in the short-run market, at least) is
moving to in-house production on directly writeable media (Kodak gold disks),
then it's *certainly* possible.

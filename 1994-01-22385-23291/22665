   This is certainly interesting.  I have never been a great fan of
   public key systems over conventional encipherment.  Public key systems
   depend upon making known an algorithm for computing a permutation and
   hoping that an attacker is not able to evaluate the inverse of that
   permutation at selected points.  Even in the general case, this is not
   obviously an intractible math problem. We can all remember the
   knapsack algorithm crashing in flames a few years back.

No offense, but this reasoning is bogus.  When you are designing a
secure system, you *HAVE* to assume that any potential attacker knows
exactly how your system works!  Therefore, there is no reason at all
to design a system where security of the system depends upon keeping
the algorithm secret.  Knowing the algorithm should not in any way
affect the security of a system.  "Security through obscurity provides
no security at all."

I, personally, would like to see the full paper -- I wonder what
claims are being made here, exactly.

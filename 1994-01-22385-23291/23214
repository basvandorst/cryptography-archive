If the starting string is really arbitrary and composed of any combination 
of 256 unique characters then you cannot guarantee any compression.

If you are using less than 256 characters (straight ASCII has 128 and many
of those are 'unusual'). Then you can compress the string by using less bits per
character. If you can guarantee 64 characters or less then you can compress this
string to 6 * 60 / 8 characters or 45 chars. For all of ASCII you can compress
to 53 chars (7 * 60 / 8).

The next step is figuring out whether your string is _really_ arbitrary. For
example does it always contain lots of spaces?  In general compressing 60
chars into 10 chars is pretty hard.

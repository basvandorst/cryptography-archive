We may now have the legally stated right to send encrypted data to at least 
Canada and Mexico thanks to NAFTA. I read an artical in computerworld on the 
effects of NAFTA on the computer business in Mexico, I think it was the Dec 13
issue. Anyway, they had a neet little box in it titles NAFTA Networking which 
stated that the treaty mandates: no restrictions on cross border data flow and
no restrictions on terminal equipment and protocols (so much for making 
cripple... oh I mean clipper....oh I mean non-trademark-infringing capstone 
mandatory).

An interesting idea. I have just one question: let's say we set up a system
like this, I agree to submit my keys to escrow, and then things start
changing. A few executive orders blur the lines of authorization, some
deals are made in the Oval Office to trade pork for keys, the Supreme Court
gets a few questionable appointees, and "most of the time" becomes a reality,
along with "question of national security," "release to proper authorities,"
and "Un-American Activities."
	(If you think they wouldn't have such gall, I filled out an
application for a federally-funded research job a while ago in which some
questions about my personal life were marked "voluntary but required"!)

Here's the question: how do I take my keys back?

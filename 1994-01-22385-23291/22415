It's worse: we are not *allowed* to compete with them in encryption,
because it is illegal to export those technologies. There are other
discussions on this, but would the Clipper chip be restricted the
same way, crippling workstation exports?

Their experience is in *breaking*, not making security. Moreover,
their results are never published, thus never permitting peer review
to expose and fix flaws in encryption standards. In addition, they
have every incentive to create and conceal a backdoor into the
encryption. Because they will not permit public review of the
algorithm, only a review by a small and "approved" group of experts,
there could easily be one not discoverable to those experts. This is
consistent with NSA's approach of "tell nothing to anyone".

One can't separate these. A non-escrow system, where only the client
has the key and it is buried in the physical hardware, impossible or
at least difficult to capture, is easily developed. Instead, an
expensive bureacracy would be created, with unknown authority and
limitations. This is a potentially dangerous situation where once a
key is obtained, possibly without a warrant, the tapping agency could
invisibly decrypt that signal at any time, at no additional expense
and with no new warrant.

Don't forget the costs of criminals, spies, terrorists, DEA agents,
FBI agents, NSA agents, etc. who would use the escrow system against
law-abiding citizens.

Bureaucratic accounting doesn't work that way. If they can get the money
for their department, they don't care how much more it costs.

Secret algorithms too easily have undiscovered holes. This is why peer
review is so critical now to the development of secure systems.

They are serving their own security interests, *not* the private
sector's.  The private sector does not want or require government
escrow houses, secret security algorithms, mandated NSA sponsored
standards, etc. They want the government to *permit* them to develop,
install, and sell security algorithms throughout the world, without
interference.

You, sir, are mistaken. Consider the recent furors over PGP and DES
exportation, or attempts to outlaw new phone systems without approved
wiretapping techniques installed. They are *not* helping.

No, they needn't. This is security through obscurity, a tempting but
very dangerous practice.

There is absolutely *no* evidence that Clipper systems would have
prevented the WTC bombing, there is no strong evidence that anything
more than broadly accessible DES or PGP is necessary to prevent
foreign espionage of any sort, and how many *more* contracts have been
lost by US refusal to permit DES export?

Only as long as other encryption standards are outlawed for export and
otherwise restricted.

There is no evidence that it will remain voluntary. And the government
has little right or need to spend the money to develop it without public
awareness or examination of the system.

David, you still sound like an apologist for government spending and
encroachments on our civil liberties. Who *do* you work for?

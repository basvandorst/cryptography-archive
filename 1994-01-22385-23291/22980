Fellow Netters,
    This is an unsolicited testimonial for a book I just picked up at  
Bookstop, Appled Cryptography by Bruce Schneier (published by John Wiley  
and Sons). For the novice (like me), it is a very good introduction to  
Cryptography. It seems to cover a broad range of topics without being  
overly mathematically involved. The book is divided into five sections.  
The first three being related to cryptographic protocols, techniques, and  
algorithms. Section four is a survey of 'Real World' Implementations and  
political considerations. The last section includes source code for  
several different crypto algorithms including Enigma, DES, IDEA (and many,  
many more). Perhaps the best section is all the way in the back. Over 900  
bibliographic references to articles and books on subjects ranging from  
crypto protocols to esoteric algebra.
    In other words, a really great book!

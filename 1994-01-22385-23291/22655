I haven't heard the second claim here.  What I did see was someone's
critique of GOST (Diffie? I can't remember who wrote it and I didn't
save it) in which they say the GOST is weaker because ``it lacks the
permutation''. I believe this refers not to the initial permutation of
DES, but to the permutation P which is part of DES's round funtion.

The permutation P of DES causes the output of each S box to affect the
input of 6 S-boxes in the next round, acheiving a complete avalanche
effect in only three rounds.  GOST has an 11-bit shift here instead,
which means it needs eight rounds to acheive a complete avalanche. 

A `complete avalanche' means that every bit of the input to the
round function affects every bit of output.  Since GOST takes more
than twice as many rounds as DES to do this, it seems weaker despite
having twice as many rounds overall.

A while ago I posted something to this newsgroup asking about
computer security and crypto conferences. All the info. I have
now is pretty much out of date. Can people please respond to me
in personal e-mail and I'll post a compiled list to the group?

I have info. regarding Oakland IEEE conference, the Fanconia IEEE
Foundations workshop, and crypto '94. Please send me any info/call
for papers on other ones. Thanks.

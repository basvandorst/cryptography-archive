I had thought the same thing.  The IP would tend to hide EBCDIC bit 
statistics for text, I thought.  But in discussion, folks pointed out
that after a number of rounds, the original bit statistics won't survive.

My current idea on the IP is that it is meant to guarantee that software 
implementations are at a significant disadvantage to hardware.  

So far, I don't see any cryptographic significance to it.

It makes sense.  Everybody has wondered about the IP, and no explanation 
has ever been offered for it.

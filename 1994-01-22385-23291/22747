Can some point me at possible source for authentication/integrity 
(suitable for inclusion in bsd type unix systems) for the
tcp/ip protocols?  Hopefully, it will provide authentication when
the TCP transport session begins and cryptographic integrity for the
duration of the connection The alternatives is to use the encapsulation
protocols developed for the ISO protocols but since I'm going to use
tcp/ip it would be better to stay clear of ISO stuff at the first four
layers. I've seen plans for encapsulation type protocols for tcp/ip but
never any C source. So, if you've seen some please let me know.  Thanks in
advance -hal.

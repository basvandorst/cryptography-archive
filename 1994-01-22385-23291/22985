Diffie-Hellman is not broken (whatever that means ...). The referencejust says that
tow people at ATT have implemented an algorithm for solving discrete logarithms - 
which had been known for several years - and they built up some auxiliary tables 
allowing them to find the secret key to a given secure RPC in several minutes ... 
among others. The clue is that secure RPC just uses a key which is too short (192 
bits). The answer to your worry is, like for RSA, just choose your key length large
enough and you don't have to care. Long enough, by the way, means roughly the same 
thing for RSA and DH, since the complexity of the breaking algorithms (factorization
vs. discrete logarithm) is comparable. The key length you trust for RSA, you can trust
for Diffie Hellman!

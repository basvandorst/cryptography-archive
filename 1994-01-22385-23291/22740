Any time you put the key in an executable, it is always possible
to get it out by disassembling the image running in RAM.  You 
can certainly obscure it from the simple attacks you mention.
I recommend generating an encryption key on the fly by xor-ing
variables stored in different places in the program together.
That way the actual key does not exist in the executable file.

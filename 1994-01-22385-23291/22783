Hi again, folks. I'm the original poster of this thread (it's included at the
bottom for posterity).

I'm pleased/surprised at the amount of response I've received on this.  Let
me elaborate on my work.  I'm on UNIX.  Writing an 'Expert System Shell' and
a knowledge base to handle intelligent evaluation of UNIX audit trails (e.g.
Sun's C2 or BSM audit trails) (looking for security problems and other things).

The audit trails exist on many audit servers throughout the organization but
I'll be sending them to a central location for processing and long term
storage.  The transfer will be done electronically and without human
intervention.  I will use a public key encryption scheme to provide both
encryption and digital signature (I want to ensure the "sender" computer
trusts the "sendee" and vice versa to thwart malicious flooding at my
server.  Plus, I want the data encrypted because I may be sending more than
just the audit trails, and I want no one to intercept the comms and be able
to tell what I'm collecting at that time (if they knew and could break in,
they would know what tracks to cover to ensure I didn't see their trail)).

[preaching to the choir -->] in PK encryption, you normally publish your
public key and modulus but I see no reason to publish this, since the
communicating objects are operating in their own universe: no need for
joe-user to know what the public key is to my system, eh?

The systems are sitting in pseudo-untrusted areas (if they were trusted,
I wouldn't bother with my project, probably ;-) so I can't be sure that
someone won't get access to the executable on the remote systems.  If they
do, I don't want to just hand them my key in an flat file, I want to try
to disguise it in the code itself.

With that said, I'll let the thread continue to wind, if it so chooses.
I appreciate the dialogue with all who have contributed and with those
who will after this is posted.

   Hi folks -- am wondering how to encrypt data with in an executable
   program.  For example, if you wanted to have an ecryption key in
   a program but don't want it to be found by running "strings" or
   "od" or some such... Any hints or places I can look for info?

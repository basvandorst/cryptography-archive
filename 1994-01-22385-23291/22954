A one time pad is the only crypto system in use today that is "perfect"
in the sense of being mathematically provable as unbreakable.  Most other
systems rely on being simply very time-consuming to break.  Given infinte
time, I can break any RSA key in the universe.  A one time cipher pad can
never be broken no matter how much time and CPU power I have.

The basic principles is to modulate your message with a stream of 100%
random noise.  Someone at the other end has the exact same series of random
digits and can thus extract the original message out again.  No one in the
middle can tell the real message from the noise.  This stream of digits can
only be used once or an attacker con correlate the two messages, factor out
the noise, and decrypt them both.  In practice, this is implemented by a
pad of sheets with randomly generated characters on it.

The trouble with the one time pad is that it is cumbersome and inefficient.
It requires enough pads to cover all desired future communications and these
must be kept physically secure until used (and destroyed thereafter).  All
in all, it's a major pain compared to something quick and transparent like
DES or PGP.  As far as I know (who knows what that's worth) nobody but the
serious spook services use them, and then only for stuff that's really
vitally secure.

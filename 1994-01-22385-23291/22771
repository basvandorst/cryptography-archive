I recently came into possesion of a PC/XT board that has an
encyption chip on it. The board is a half-height, 8 bit, ISA board.

The chip itself is what I trying to find out about. It has these
markings:

   (circle-c (copyright)) WDC '79
                          WD 2001-PH
                          20-02  8601

The chip is a 28 pin plastic DIP, socketed on the board. It is
said to do DES encryption.

Does anybody have an idea of where I can get a spec sheet  for this
chip, and/or information on how to get  program code to access it.

Replies by email, preferably. I'm posting this into several different
newsgroups (sci.crypt, comp.security.misc, comp.lsi, and
comp.sys.ibm.pc.hardware.chips)

Thanks...

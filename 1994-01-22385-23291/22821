In response to which, I want to know:  If you think the cypherpunks are
such despicable, criminally-inclined people, then why do you use PGP?
Why are (or were) you on PGP-DEV?  Why do you read this newsgroup?  Why
do you post to it?  And especially, why do you feel compelled to hide
behind someone else's .sig?

If it is not obvoius, for any e and n, the message text MUST NOT 
represent a number less then n ^-e else a simple nth root would 
be all that is needed. Real uses of RSA pad out messages with random 
data. The larger e the smaller is n^ -e but then that does not matter 
since you have the padded value some where between n and n/ 2^16 
(Padded as used in PEM)

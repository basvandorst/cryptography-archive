SIGINT stands for Signals Intelligence, meaning the intelligence
that can be gathered by capturing and analyzing the target's
communications.  It is not limited to "eavesdropping" and "wire-
tapping" or simple interception of communications.  Of course
it subsumes cryptanalysis but it also includes direction finding.

Part of SIGINT concerns Traffic Analysis - analyzing communication
patterns, sources, and destinations.  Such analysis can reveal a lot
about enemy movements and pending enemy actions.

SIGINT, of course, can be applied to anybody with a means of
communications.  You may be using unbreakable encryption in all
email to your terrorist friends, but when those friends of yours
blow up buildings in major cities, you can expect the feds to
come and investigate you.  In this case, what you would need
first is a comms method with LPI - Low Probability of Intercept.

Now, try to get someone to define COMSEC.  Fascinating stuff.

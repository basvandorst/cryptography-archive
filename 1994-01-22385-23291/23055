Conventional CDs are pressed, incorporating a serial number would require
making an expensive master for each serial number!  Plus the extra cost
of pressing small batches (1, 5, whatever of each number).

Several companies have been working on write-only CDs.  The only one I
know of in wide use is Kodak's Photo CD - of course you must fill it up,
otherwise someone with Photo CD writing equipment could add extra (virus
infected?) files.  I don't know the pricing (perhaps US$20? per disk),
it is certainly much more expensive than a bulk pressing - but may be
appropriate for some purposes ...

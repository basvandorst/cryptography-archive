You are under the mistaken impression that there is a person who is the
"leader" of cypherpunks. (I am also not aware of the message in question
saying we should all abandon PGP, but then I read only a small portion of
the traffic on cypherpunks).

Some people on the cypherpunks list ARE working on PGP.
Some people on the cypherpunks list ARE working on RSAREF based applications.
Some people on the cypherpunks list have even contributed both to PGP and
   to some RSAREF based application.

Cypherpunks are not a group of people dedicated to an all-powerful 
leader. Just because someone you think might be a leader may have said that
we should abandon RSAREF, or abandon PGP, or get together an armed militia
and storm Fort Meade, doesn't mean that anyone is going to do or not
do something.
 
I think we all agree that it is a good thing to spread cryptographic 
technology for applications which protect privacy, allow anonymity, 
and give secure authentication &c. However, we certainly don't all 
agree as to what applications are most important or exactly how to go 
about it.

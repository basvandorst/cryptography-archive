I know one thing;  Even if it compresses better and faster than anything
else out there (and while the figures I saw posted showed it was somewhat
better but not anything to jump up and down about), as long as a version
in source is not available for use on UNIX for any kind of reasonable
price, I will not be interested in it, nor will I be suggesting others
get it, either.  If that small difference between it and other existing
utilities is that important, its time to get a bigger drive.

Better, IMO, to run a slightly slower, perhaps have slightly less
compression, but KNOW what is in that executable.  And know it will be
available on the target machine, because if nothing else, one can either
cross-compile an executable or include source for an extraction utility.
What is in the utility and what it does is nice to know if the program
will ever be run at root privileges in any kind of secure environment.
It also makes it nice to be able to customize it for one's own specific
needs if one desires.  A progam, from an unknown corporation with no
track record (I assume this is a company basing most of its existance
on this one utility) with no source available does not engender confidence,
especially from the more paranoid sites that are serious about security
issues.

Just ain't worth it.  Not even for ten bucks a copy.

Remember, this is a compression utility, not the next Lotus 123.  Even
a glitzy user interface it still remains a compression utility.  You
would be far better getting some kind of protection on what makes it a
breakthrough and copyrighting the code, then sell it with the source
for an affordable fee, and not presume up front all your customers are
a bunch of thieves, IMO.

Or just figure "to hell with it" and go for the MSDOS market, and forget
the UNIX and others.

That is one reason I used zoo even when other archivers gave better
compression, and still use it in its high compression mode in preference
to the others.  For big packages, I use tar and GNU-zip (because it
does a good job, and is capable of handling the regular UNIX compressed
files).

UC2 might be nice, but I strongly doubt if it will ever become a
multi-platform standard.  I don't know if even Rahul Dhesi realizes
the contribution he made by making zoo available.  But its right up
there with all the other landmarks.  I compressed and archived more
stuff than I could even try to count with it, and its pipe extraction
for viewing is really a nice touch.  (Thanks, Rahul!)

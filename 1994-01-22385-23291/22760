Issuing a SCSI Format Medium command writes a data pattern on all blocks
of the media.  I can't imagine what this "alternate cylinders" thing
you talk about relates to.  SCSI disks work by logical block address,
not cylinder/tk/sector from the perspective of the SUN SCSI driver.
With things like Zone Bit Recording, even the calculation translating
LBA into c/t/s is a pain in the butt.

Back in 1984 I wrote firmware for the MDB ESMD controllers that, at 
the punch of a button on the controller, opened write gate and wrote
asynchronous psudorandom crap on the cylinders one by one, with
about 16 revolutions per cylinder.  A similar function was provided
on some VAX systems in South Africa owned by an anti-aparthied 
newspaper, but this was in VAX assembly code.  It was a secure delete
function that wrote 16 patterns on each block.

NSA has approved a number of systems for zapping a disk over the years,
and I seriously doubt that they've overlooked Sun all this time.  
The function you describe is nothing new.  People do it all the time.

Now, you might get some argument over how many patterns must be written
on a disk before the data is completely gone.  NSA says 16, if memory
serves.  I suspect more than 4, if the erasure patterns are unknown,
would be a complete impossibility to compromise assuming the tracks 
on the disk have not shifted in the radial dimension.  If they have,
then _no_ amount of patterns will erase the data completely as the
"edges" of each track will still exist, and with ferrous fluid and
a microscope and a bunch of time one could deduce the original bit
pattern.

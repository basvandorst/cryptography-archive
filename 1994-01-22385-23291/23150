All:

If this is inappropriate to this group please accept
my apologies ahead of time.

I have a string that can be up to 60 characters long.
I need a unique string that is approx. 10 characters long
(can be longer, but we would like something compact).

And example of the starting string is:

Euro$, Mar 15 94,EuPt,96.500,Mar 14,100-16,Jun  6 94;NY

It is made up of an arbitrary collection of fields from
a record so any pattern discerned from above is purely
coincidental.

We would prefer to have a string of digits so encrypting/
compressing comes to mind, but we need less digits than the
starting number of characters.

All answers would be appreciated.  If it is in a FAQ, just
please say which one.  Reply by e-mail to cvalcarc@lehman.com.

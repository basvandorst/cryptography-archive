 I don't think this is a good explanation either, because only
 vulnerability to practical attack matters for user. How can you 
 know that by strengthening against diff.cryptoanalisys you 
 did not introduce some weakness ? 

 My message is, that if diff.cryptoanalisys is important and considered
 as such, there must be something more to it then I know.

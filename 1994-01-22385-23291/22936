Julian, John or whoever called first:

	Not sure if this info will be old news, but the only
system that I know of that uses a one-time pad is the Vignere
encryption scheme.  Some government-types out in the field
encrypt their data by hand with this method, and then send it 
over the airwaves coded.  The table is easy, albeit monotonous, 
to use, and you should be able to find a copy with the very simple 
instructions in an encyclopaedia under cryptography.  You can
use whatever you like for the "key" a single word repeated
endlessly, an obscure poem, or a random jumble of letters on a
one-time pad.  Feel free to write back direct.  Good luck.

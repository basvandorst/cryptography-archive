Exactly.  There's a lot of confusion between the terms ``one-time pad''
and ``Vernam cipher''.  Vername originated the idea of exclusive-or'ing
the ciphertext with the key.  But there are all sorts of ways to generate
the key stream.  If the key stream is chosen as per Dan's definition,
(well, I'd add the word ``randomly'' before ``chosen'') the cipher is
theoretically unbreakable.  If you use some other bit stream -- the output
of MD5 of car license plates, DES in output feedback, whatever -- the
strength is that of the underlying key generation mechanism.  This is *not*
a one-time pad.

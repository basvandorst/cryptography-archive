I heard that Apple and Sun have a new way of distributing software on
CD-ROMs.  Both companies allow users to try out any number of software
programs on the CD-ROM before making a purchase.  Once the users make
a choice, they can call a 1-800 number to pay for the software, and 
to get a key/code/password to obtain the full program immediately.

How does this CD-ROM distribution scheme work?

What kind of cryptography is being used to prevent the programs
from being stolen?

How difficult will it be to penetrate and disable the protection?

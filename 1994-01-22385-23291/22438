   AHA!  First you say it is "illegal to export cryptos", now you
   are saying "certain kinds of cryptos".  You're backpedalling.

I did not make the original claim that it is "illegal to export crypto"
(that was made by someone else).  However, it is de facto illegal to
export strong crypto, such as DES, in a form that makes it possible to
encrypt and decrypt arbitrary messages with user-specified keys, because
the government doesn't grant export licenses.

   Yes.

Let me clarify this.  Have you ever managed the release of an operating
system, and had to deal with this?  I don't mean a single monolithic
program, I mean a release of an entire operating system?

   I count this as whining.   Surely a few #ifdefs will fix
   things right up.

It's not the source code changes that are the problem -- it's the
release process itself.  It requires two separate system builds, two
sets of test runs (suppose the #ifdef's have some unexpected effect?),
two sets of tape cuts, and so forth.

In the example I gave, it was indeed a single #ifdef that was required.
That was the least of the problem.

I have a hard time believing that anyone would bother to disassemble
the program to see how you wrote the code...

That's because you inserted the word "commercial".  *Your* license
specifically prohibits me from *giving it away* with archives of *free*
software.  Section 2.E, paragraph 8.  None of the others do as far as I 
know.

With Info-ZIP, I can include a copy of unzip for DOS and UNIX on a
disk, whether the archived stuff is commercial or free.

OK, so you're fixing this problem as well.

Yes, but I seriously doubt anyone will want to disassemble it once the
file format (and hence compression method) is publicly known...
I doubt the Info-ZIP folks bothered to disassemble PKzip, for
instance.

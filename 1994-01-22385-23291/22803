The alternative was to patent the technology and lock out a completely
new area in compression, as many did before us. We choose not to do that
and allow others to invent and use the technology as well. Of cource we
do NOT want them to just copy our software in some way.

Of cource. Do you expect WordPerfect to allow you to distribute their
wordprocessor with any document you create?

Correct. We are working on this. Those interested can get beta
documentation.

Agreed. We considder to release the source code, but don't know how
to prevent people from using it otherwise than to verify our claims.

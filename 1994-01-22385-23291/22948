Long ago in another newsgroup we had quite a discussion about encryption "in 
extremis".  Even with floppies, you have to use some thought.  They are
mylar, and when you try to burn them, they melt at the flame and the
flame drops off in a puddle, leaving the rest of the floppy intact.  You
have to drench them with charcoal fluid to ensure that the whole thing
melts.  Of course, if you have an incinerator, the task should be much
easier.  

However, burning floppies give off a terribly noxious smell.  So you better
think of ventilation if you have to destroy a bunch of them in an 
emergency.  

Finally, one guy told us of misadventures destroying classified paper.
It seems that he was on some island in the Med when Khaddafi made 
threatening motions.  The military uses thermal grenades to quickly
destroy things.  I'm told that one of these things can fuse a howitzer.
Anyhow, they pulled the pins on the thermite plates placed on the filing
cabinets.  But because the cabinets didn't have an air supply, the thermite
burned right through the papers, the cabinet and the floor.  There were
some charred papers, but they weren't destroyed.

Next, they gathered all classified papers, threw them into a concrete
pit, then threw thermite grenades on top.  Unfortunately, the grenade
burned right through the concrete floor and through a water main.  Which
extinguished the fire.

They finally got the papers destroyed by burning them in oil drums, but
it was quite a mess.

The guy's point was that you don't know how encryption in extremis will
work out under actual conditions.

I got to wondering about destroying sensitive data when a rape crisis
clinic in Rhode Island burned all their papers.  It seems both sides in
a rape subpoenaed their confidential records.  The clinic felt that it
could not serve rape victims without absolute confidentiality of their
records, and they realized that they could not protect their records.
So they destroyed them.

But I think it is also a serious consideration generally.  Suppose one of
our embassies is seized as in Iran.  Today, a lot of confidential 
information is on hard disks.  In an emergency, how would an embassy 
destroy them?

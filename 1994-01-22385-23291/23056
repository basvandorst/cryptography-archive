Actually, I believe there may be a real potential risk to lottery players who
choose some form of an autolotto, where the lottery's computer selects the
numbers for you.  I have no idea what selection algorithm is used here in
Ohio -- and I doubt it would be released to me if I asked -- but if the
algorithm does not guarantee an equal distribution of probabilities across
all valid number groups -- if it favors some combinations over others --
then the probability of the given set of numbers assigned to me also being
assigned to someone else who plays the autolotto becomes greater than the
chance that happening due to random selection.  The result is that, if my
numbers are drawn, there is a higher probability that I will not be the
sole winner, and the expected value of my purse goes down accordingly.

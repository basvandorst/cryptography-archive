In other words, you don't have to give us the info, but if you don't, we
don't have to approve your app, either! <g>

If I understand correctly, you can't.  The keys are actually embedded in the
chip itself, and issued to you by them.  I wonder how they prevent someone
from reverse-engineering the chip itself, in order to clone it with a USER
DEFINABLE key?  Maybe it's like the Video Cipher II system, where the code
is stored in volatile RAM.  Any disruption to the circuit, theoretically,
erases the memory.

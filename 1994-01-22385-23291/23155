Is the Capstone chip available yet? Where could I get one, if so?
Does it have only one data bus, or one for input and one for output?

If only one, it wouldn't be too hard to interface one to a parallel
port or put it on a prototyping card to experiment with. Some interesting
things to do would be: use the modexp function and random generator for
fast PGP encryption, with real random numbers. Use the SHS hash to super-
encrypt the Skipjack LEAF (assuming it will let you do a SHS hashing
between generating the LEAF and loading the other chip's LEAF).
After the LEAF is loaded, is the output the same length as the input, or
longer? If it's the same length, the LEAF is only sent once and super-
encrypting it would block the key escrow. If the output is longer, the
LEAF is probably mixed into the data at random intervals, in which case
you'd have to superencrypt the whole data stream.

What are RSA's licensing terms like? (I read the RSA FAQ; no details)
Big companies can apparently buy flat-rate licenses. Can a small company
buy a royalty-only license, with no up-front fee? How expensive are the
royalties? Can you share your source code?

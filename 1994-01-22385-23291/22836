So sorry, Reverend King.  You see, David Sternlight says you 
"may not pick and choose" which regulations to obey.  Back of the bus, please.

Oh, please.

1. I assume even you would agree that some regulations are unduly burdensome,
right?

2. Is it not reasonable to point out that our economy is the less efficient
for these?   And since, by hypothesis, those regulations are unduly 
burdensome, they can be lifted or modified without net harm, right?

3. Therefore those regulations *should* be removed.  Correct?

4. Bad Regulations recognized in this way shouldn't be treated with 
particular reverence, any more than a kidney stone is held to be a
part of the body on a par with (say) the optic nerve.  It's not
as if government is held arise from Divine right.  Such justified
existence as it may have comes from consent of the governed.

If you're right, then everyone drives under 55 or 65 on the national 
highways.  And, of course, nobody pays off the Mob to avoid 
trouble in the garbage business...  And naturally, politicians 
(who administer these regulations For Our Own Good) are recognized as 
paragons of honor.

A nice, clean, testable suggestion you've made, David.  Unfortunately...

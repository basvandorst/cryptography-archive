     I'd once looked at a related problem, that of encoding information
in executable code in such a way that it couldn't be removed by the
user.  One might want to encode a serial number that way, for example.

     One really effective method, although it is a huge pain from the
software manufacturing standpoint, is to permute the compiler's register
allocation algorithm based on the serial number.  This embeds serial
number information all through the object program.  There's no easy way
to remove the serial number info without constructing a full 
disassembly, analysis, and repermutation tool, which still might break
the program.

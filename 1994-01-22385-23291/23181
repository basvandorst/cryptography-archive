That was code-cracking rather than cryptanalysis. MAGIC intercepts had 
turned up plans for a Japanese invasion of a target codenamed, I believe, FI.
Naval Intelligence was pretty sure FI was Midway bnut they wanted to be 
certain. So they concocted a story about a water shortage on Midway and 
put it out where Japanese sigint would pick it up. Sure enough, the
listeners presently picked up a report back to Tokyo of a water shortage
on FI. (This is document in Gordon Prage's book on Midway, the title of
which I can't recall. May also be in Lewin book on MAGIC.)

Please excuse my naivete, but I have not been following this issue that
closely.  What exactly is the gov't doing that has everyone so upset?
Are they completely outlawing the use of any crypto technology other
than clipper?  If not, what's the big deal about clipper?  Anyone who
wants to use a more secure chip is free to do so, so why not just let
the gov't produce the chips and let the product gather dust on the
shelves?

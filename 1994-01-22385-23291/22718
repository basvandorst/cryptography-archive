There have been a few attempts at this on commercial as well as hobby software.
Usually games that have the "secrets" of the game internalized in the image.
I found a copy of the well known adventure game that encrypted its messages
so that they could not be "dumped".  Another game called "tingle" was available
on TOPS-10 and TOPS-20 with an encrypted internal database that defied many
attempts at dumping.

New video games are starting to use "image compression" to reduce storage
(thats not encryption but it still is hard to get the images out!!). 

You can build a key with code - you don't have to have it appear literally
in the image.

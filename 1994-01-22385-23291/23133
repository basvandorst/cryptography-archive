crypt uses the user input key (8 bytes, 7 bits each) as the regular key
to DES. ( whihc demands 8 7bit bytes as the key- the 8th is parity in
DES) It then encrypts the "message 00000000" (8 bytes of all 0) 25 times
( 25 was to slow it down to try to foil crackers- now it should probably
be 25000).
To reverse would be equivalent to finding the key given a know encrypted
plaintext ( 0) and the encrypted text ( the  encrypted password). Nobody has
figured out how to break DES ( get the key given some encrypted known
text) "Thus" noone knows how to reverse crypt. 
(some niggles- crypt nuses a modified DES- the salt alters the
encryption routine. might it be that crypt is actually far easier to
bread than DES for selected salts?)
Impossible? Who knows? But not known now ( except with brute force- try
evey possible password and see which one works-which may be doable by
some dedicated rich cracker is a few hours with special hardware.

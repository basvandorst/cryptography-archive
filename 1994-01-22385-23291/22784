A SCSI Format Media command doesn't NEED to write any information att
all. I know discs that returns immidatley without doing anything,
discs that do a read test on the whole disc (rather common) and discs
that actually writes data after that command.

With most disc you can force them to erase all data in one way or
another. For quantum discs for example you have to change the filler
byte (I dont remember which page it was in), or else it WONT overwrite
the data on the disc. I dont know if it still works this way, but it
sure works this way for quantum-discs that is a year or two old.

Good points.  The secrecy intrigues me, it was so disadvantageous to both
IBM and the NSA.  Why did they keep their mouths shut, when the obvious
thing to do was to be open.  I mean after the initial suspicions.

Another thing that intrigues me is the idea of avalanching.  I don't see
an a priori reason to suppose that avalanching is good.  Naively, it
would seem that each round of avalanching would undo some previous
rounds.  How can we show that the avalanching is cumulative instead of
self-cancelling?

Could the proof of cumulative rounds be the deep dark secret?  I mean,
if we knew how to design rounds that were cumulative, then we could
build a bigger, better DES couldn't we?  And yet, so far as I can
tell, nobody really knows how to design S boxes.  Or, have I not
been keeping up with the literature?

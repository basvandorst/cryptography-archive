Knuth doesn't define cryptographic randomness, as I recall.

One possible definition:

a cryptographically secure PRNG is one such that no possible program,
knowing the structure of the PRNG and all of its output bits so far, can
guess the next output bit with anything better than probability 1/2.

So -- in a sense, this is a program testing for randomness but the test
itself is far from polynomial since it involves running all possible
programs and hardly what I'd call a program.  I would therefore have to say
that a program testing for randomness is meaningless.

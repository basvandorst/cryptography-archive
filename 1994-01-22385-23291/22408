Most interesting!  I'd received a private reply that presented a basic
difference between compression and encryption, but the detailed explanation
is fascinating.  As the Subject says, I'm new to all this.

Since optimally compressed files look essentially the same as highly encrypted
ones (i.e., random gibberish with an optional header), legislation to outlaw
encryption could easily spill over into the compression field.  Gibberish is
gibberish, no matter how or why it's created.

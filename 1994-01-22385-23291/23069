Yes, please put this in the FAQ so that it is made obvious even to people
like me that differential cryptanalysis is the deep dark secret that kept
IBM from being open about the S box design.

I heard about differential cryptanalysis, and knew it was kept secret, but
didn't make the connection that it was THE secret.

John Kelsey has been straightening me out on my confusions.  I've got some
reading to do.

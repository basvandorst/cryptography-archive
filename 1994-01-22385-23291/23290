Summary: Question about cordless telephone signal scrambling
Keywords: cordless telephone scrambling


   I'm not certain this is the right place to post this, but there were a
couple of threads here several weeks ago on the same topic.  Can anyone
point me in the direction of manufacturers who sell cordless telephones
which scramble the signal between the handset and the base unit?

   I'm not really concerned with with encrypting the signal through the
wire, but I 'd like to cut out my neighbors with scanners and nothing
better to do.  ;)

E-mail or post here.  Thanks in advance for your help.  Is there a more
appropriate group to whom I should have posted this?

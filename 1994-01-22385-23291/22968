What's a 'software program'?  (Is there any other kind of program?)


The CD-ROM you mention has all the play-for-pay programs encryptded
with the same secret key; if one recipient of the secret key decides
to cheat, all security is lost.  It depends for its success on the
honest of the people who buy the software -- it assumes they have an
incentive to keep the key secret because they paid a lot of money for
it.

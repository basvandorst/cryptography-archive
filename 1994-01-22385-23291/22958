Hello Internet,

a new PGP public key server has been setup; this time in the Netherlands.
It is a mail-only server, no anon-ftp. The address of the server is

pgp-public-keys@kub.nl

the service is already synchronized with the other international keyservers,
although I will ask more servers to directly sync with me in the near future.

The system running the service is directly connected to Tilburg University's
FDDI ring, which is one 2 Mbps hop away from Delft, which is one 34 Mbps hop
away from Amsterdam, which will soon have its Europanet/EMPB/Dante fatpipe
to the USA. It should be well connected...

For the time being, the server starts up every 15 minutes.

greetings,

teun

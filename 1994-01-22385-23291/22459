I think this to be of trivial economic value compared to the economic
information loss from current systems used by our private sector and
protected by what the government obviously thinks to be weaker algorithms.
One lost oil exploration bid on a good field (because a foreign competitor
either alone or with the aid of his government could read our bid) is worth
far more to the U.S. than all the workstation sales we lost because of some
foreign workstation with better crypto resources. Recall also that in many
if not most cases, foreigners can still buy our workstations and then add
their own crypto systems, so if the workstation were truly competitive we'd
still sell to most of the market.

I know what I'm talking about here, having been the victim of industrial
espionage on 3 different projects valued at a billion dollars (no typo)
each. Fortunately, the perpetrators were also American companies and the
government told them if they didn't knock it off they'd be disqualified. In
the end we won all three. I believe this wouldn't have happened had the
competitor been foreign and encouraged and maybe even aided, rather than
discouraged by their governments in committing such economic espionage.

A major responsibility of the NSA since its inception has been the security
of our own communications.

This assumes that the loss from exposure is less than from lack of peer
review, and also that peers are at least as qualified and experienced as the
government's own people in this field. Neither assumption can be sustained
in the large, and in the small the very few who might be as good as NSA's
best might not be willing to be involved under the conditions the government
would have to make to preserve security, as we've seen in refusals to
participate by some in the Clipper review committee.

I've addressed this point elsewhere in some detail, but to summarize, for
policy discussion and setting purposes it's not only easy to separate the
two, but essential so to do since different issues, objectives, and economic
rationale is involved for the provision of crypto without escrow and for the
addition of escrow. Once the system is decided on, it's decided on, of
course.

That's why one should focus on making sure the escrow system will perform as
advertised, and not otherwise. Since this is the government's offer, they
would, and have welcomed discussion of these specific issues.

They already have the money whether Clipper is adopted or not. Since the
escrow agencies, which might get additional money, haven't been decided on,
they haven't been a party to the allegedly self-interested arguments you
claim are being made.

The holes we know about and that are used as evidence for this assertion are
in publicly known algorithms widely peer reviewed, with such holes
discovered some time after the fact. Further, from what little that has
leaked, the government has been very good at finding holes in other people's
systems in the past. If anything, this points to the much smaller available
peer review resources and time in the private sector than that in the
governmeent. It suggests that cries for private sector peer review IN THIS
AREA are wrong-headed and not at all about the relative technical
effectiveness of such peer review but rather about distrust of the
government--a separate and different subject.

You are taking a special meaning for private sector here than that I
used--namely those in the private sector who are narrowly concerned with
selling crypto themselves without regard to other issues.

The public does want the government to provide national security services,
and this is a Constitutionally enshrined desire. The public does want the
government to spend money on economic protection and betterment and there is
no dispute about this, only about the means and details.

In the large the escrow system speaks to the above. Of course if one puts on
blinders and focusses only on the act of using crypto systems nobody in the
private sector has asked for escrow houses.

Similarly, the national security issue in the large means that if the
Clipper algorithm is truly unbreakable at present states of the art, then
the algorithm must be kept secret to prevent its use without escrow to
thwart the government's national security duties. In that sense the public
does demand this, though not explicitly in the small.

When no standards exist, or when the private sector hasn't achieved them
voluntarily there is a well established role for government, without which
many standards would never be adopted, with consequent economic loss. This
is particularly important when the few directly involved private sector
(read specific industry companies) actors find such standards against their
narrow interest even when in the overwhelming public interest. Energy
conservation in the early days is a good example. So are building standards
and many other examples one could give.

Sure. And I know of some people who'd like to sell dope in high school
without government interference. That doesn't make it in the public
interest.

There is no legal challenge to the established role of the government with
respect to DES or PGP. What some want is to change it for reasons of
self-interest.

As to the wiretap proposal that is a different matter and involves attempts
to go beyond the established role. As you know so far Congress has shot that
down. They have not done so with Clipper.

Security through obscurity is a jingoistic phrase that is actually
misleading. It originally referred to cases where one thought an algorithm
couldn't be broken if it were kept secret.

The Clipper issue is quite different. It is that if the algorithm is
actually strong, publishing it would allow others to use it "against" us.
Thus FOR THE U.S. it is not a COMSEC issue but a COMINT issue, unlike that
to which "security through obscurity" refers.

Correct on the WTC bombing. It was a point about the economic values
involved. Incorrect about DES or PGP. Some here who are credible have
estimated that those with the money for the capital costs can break DES for
$25 a time. We don't know about RSA or IDEA (PGP is not cryptographically
unique--it simply uses RSA and IDEA, just as Ripem uses RSA and Triple DES,
etc.), since most assertions about RSA have been based on factoring, and
IDEA hasn't been around very long.

By the way, I'm profoundly impressed by the aphorism recently used by
another to the effect that there are no trapdoors, just bad (so far)
inverses.

No. There is no plan to do this. But if Clipper is really algorithmically
more secure than other publicly available algorithms, my statement stands.
Since we don't know, better to err on the side of caution.

Sure there is. The government has said so. What you mean is "there is no
proof that it will remain voluntary"--quite a different matter. The latter
test, if applied generally, could stop all progress.

I have learned through hard experience not to respond to such questions,
since they inevitably take a discussion off its substance.

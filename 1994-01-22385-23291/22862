The executable for NDC5 (MS-DOS) is available by anonymous ftp from
cyberspace.com in directory pub/ndc5.  Filename is ndc5.zip.

Originally published in 1986, this is an implementation of Carl Nicolai's
work in Non-Deterministic cryptography, originally described in CRYPTO 82.
Since this is distributed as published information, and is distributed without
regard to buyer, ITAR export regulations should not apply (unless we are
told otherwise).

Source code is available.  See ZIP file for info.

Let's suppose I have a radioactive source, a nice low dead-time
proportional counter and a PC (I do.)  Suppose I wanted to 
connect this up to sit in a corner generating random numbers,
perhaps to make available via FTP or other means.  How would
I do this?  I'm an accomplished electronics and instrumentation
designer but am a complete novice at crypto and number theory.
I'd LOVE to get my hands on some already written code. 
I can do something like toggling a bit on the parallel port with
each nuclear event.  What I do after that is a mystery.  Anyone
interested in collaborating on this?

John

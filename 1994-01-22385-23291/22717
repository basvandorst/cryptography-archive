Let's just stop at the first question.  The Data Encryption Standard
was a standard issued by ANSI Approved Standards Committee X3 (Computer
Standards).  As with all X3 standards, it had a limited life and needed a
renewal.  It never got it.  It is no longer an ANSI standard.  

I believe it may still be a FIPS (US govt std).  I do not believe it ever
made it as an ISO std.

I used to sit on X3 as the DECUS representative about the time the DES
standard stuff came up.  We realized DES was insecure and I noticed no
desire on the part of the committee to endorse an insecure security
standard.

As to why no new technology encryption standards were promuligated...
the Spooks who control Federal policy in this area did not want new
standards.  So, it 'just never came up' :)

These spooks did informally propose that we endorse a 'We can not tell you 
how this standard works but, trust us, it is secure' system.  I noticed no
desire on the part of the committee to endorse such an system.  It 'just
never came up' (formally) during my tenure.

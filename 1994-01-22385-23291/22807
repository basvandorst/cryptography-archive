Obviously you have no idea what the previous poster meant by 'crypto
signature'.

YOU THINK he means something like a digitized picture of a handwritten
signature, like you put on a UPS document.

WHAT HE REALLY MEANS is a cryptographically-secure unforgeable
authenticator token -- essentially, a magic number that could only
have been created by the legal recipient.

I'd like to just clear up a point of terminology. Recent projects
by the US government to automate certain purely civilian functions like
automating billing within the government itself are using the term
"electronic" signature to be an image of the signers actual written 
signature.  This is part of a modernization effort where by documents
are to be handled as an image complete with written signature. 

Given the current state of the art in image doctoring the security of this
scheme seems poor at best. The term digital signature I think is being
reserved to denote the crypto based signature variety such as DSA and the
RSA based signatures.

That's perfectly true, but if the Skipjack algorithm is thought to be more
secure by ATT, and one isn't compelled to buy ATT's product, then there's no
civil liberties issue here. And unless ATT has a monopoly on secure phones
(they are a laggard in this market) there is no economic issue here.

This is true for those part of clipper involving classified matters. It is
also unexceptionable as long as Clipper is voluntary--much else the
government does in the national security area is widely accepted as right
public policy. There have been many other historical examples of a tension
between security and availability and the public policy resolution has
almost always been a compromise, as is Clipper.

This is irrational thinking. What's more, I think the evidence for the need
for more secure crypto for economic protection reasons (the stated main
intent) is widely known. Note that I don't call the writer himself
irrational, but refer specifically to his statements in the paragraph above.
Had the writer said "I don't think the government's main intent...." the
remark would be unexceptionable. It's the "I don't think that anyone
believes.." that makes it irrational.

Though this is speculative, the argument is correct if the assumptions are
correct. Like some arguments of others, this focusses on what I think to be
the right issues--making sure the escrow system cannot be abused. I think an
attempt to reject Clipper on basic policy grounds is doomed to failure, but
I think concerns that the escrow system will work as advertised and only as
advertised are legitimate, central, and important.

I don't see how this argument can be made given that Clipper will, by and
large substitute for what is now unencrypted voice, and weak single DES
(with Skipjack). It seems those concerned about Clipper are not living in
the real world in that they are comparing a real project underway (Clipper)
with a notion (something non-escrowed but secure) rather than with what it
will, by and large, replace. Thus it is a privacy improvement technology.

As to those who don't like Clipper because they think it reduces privacy,
let them not use it. If it REDUCES privacy they must believe they have
something now with more privacy. Good. Let them continue to use that.

This is illogical for the reasons given just above.

Now for a separate remark unrelated to Jim specifically. Many who dislike
Clipper make the mistake of comparing something that increases privacy with
something else they wish they had that would increase it even
further--namely a known algorithm with no escrow which is thought BY THEM
(since they don't trust the NSA) to be highly secure.

Good. Let them adopt it if they really think TDES or IDEA is such an
algorithm, and use it. If not, let them invent something and use it. But
they don't have the right to deprive others of what will be higher security
and privacy than they have now simply because they think it's possible to
produce something "even more better". The argument for "even more better"
crops up like the weeds whenever someone doesn't like a particular new thing
and wants to kill it. Instead, they should get on with "even more better"
themselves while not interfering with others' desire for "better than now".

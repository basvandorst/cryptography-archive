   Right.  More precisely, you need one randomizing bit per message-bit.

Even more precisely, you need at least as many random bits as there
are bits of information in the message.  Even then you are vulnerable
to traffic analysis.  For instance: you know that I am going to send a
message whose clear text is "YES" or "NO".  You see me transmit XW.
What was my message?

   This has one randomizing bit per six message-bits, so it's not a one-time
   pad system.


This actually has one randomizing bit per 3.5 (or so) message bits.  I
said the message was English; English has much less information per
upper case letter than log_2(26) bits.

Had I chosen randomly between 13 different offsets, you wouldn't be
able to decrypt it.  13 is the theoretical value; the practical limit
is probably rather smaller.

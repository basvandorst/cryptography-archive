I have a few questions what it means to be exportable: 

Clearly in order for the question of exportability the algorithm
in question must be produced in or paid by the land from which it
would be exported, and to my knowledge no western country but the 
U.S. will put restrictions on export (is this correct?)
If the algorithm is produced in the U.S., but by a foreign company,
is it exported if it leaves the U.S.? By foreign researchers? etc.

Does exportability only apply to algorithms or concepts, too?
If it applies to concepts, who judges if something builds on a 
concept developed in the U.S.? If not, why wouldn't a group of 
knowledgeable U.S. researchers take a trip to Mexico (say), paid by
a Maxican company, and in Mexico develop a suitable algorithm 
from the concepts they know. Living in San Diego, an hour 
away from the Mexican border, this seems so rediculously easy to do!
Then, if this is ok, would the algorithm constructors need to leave
the U.S., or is it enough that they are paid from outside?

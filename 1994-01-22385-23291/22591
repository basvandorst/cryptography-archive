  OK, let's establish a reasonable criterion for measuring this "progress".

  For instance, the major abuses of the type we're discussing can be described
in a nutshell as spanning _at least_ the period from A. Mitchell Palmer's raids
on dissidents to J. Edgar Hoover's political use of FBI assets -- i.e. circa
1917-1970.
  After the government has established a nice clean record of equal length,
we can consider arguments that they have grown up enough to be trusted with
something like the Clipper proposal.
  That is to say, let them keep their noses clean and get back to us sometime
in 2023 AD.

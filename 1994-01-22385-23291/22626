Summary: I need help pinning down author/title/publisher on a crypto book
Keywords: book


I am looking for a recently published crypto book by Schneier or Shneier -
exact spelling unknown.  I also don't know the title.  It is supposed
to be a book which has lots of crypto algorithms including C source code
implementations of many of them.

If someone who knows of this book could fill me in on the details (author,
title, publisher) I'd greatly appreciate it.

The reason I'm looking for this book is I've heard it has a good practical
description of how to implement Diffie-Hellman public key exchange.  If
you can suggest another book, or know where to get public domain source
code, please let me know.

Thank you very much.

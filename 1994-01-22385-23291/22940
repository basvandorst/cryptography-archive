We are exploring the viability of a new approach to distribute
commercial utilies for PDAs that involve posting and distributing
fully functioning programs with an activation screen.

At least one of the new PDAs have a unique ID that is pervasive
across power off resets. Our current think involves generating an
identifier that is unique for a particular device and then displaying a
panel that asks the user to call a 1800 number, quote the identifier
and they would be told what the activation code would be by the
service adviser on the phone.

I would very much like the advice on the security of such a scheme and
advice on sources of materials that would assist us in
developing the appropriate algorithm. We are quite pragmatic and
appreciate that we may have to trade off the level of bullet proofness
and simplicity. As most of the software will be uder US$50, a
very robust approach is required rather than something that can 
survive a concerted attach to crack!

Thanks in advnace.

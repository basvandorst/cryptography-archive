   Actually, one can even do better than that: Assume a 1024-bit private
   key.  Choose the IDEA key such that 40 bits (probably scattered in
   the first block of cryptotext) when taken as four groups of ten bits
   will represent the positions of four "ones" in the key.  Assuming the
   key has an even mixture of ones and zeros, about one in sixteen keys
   will have this property; exhaustively searching until one is found
   should not take long.  Given a suitable number of cryptotexts,


Have you any idea how many possible 1024-bit private keys there are?
1/16th of them is going to take you a good approximation to forever to
search.


   however, it would be possible to produce a list of one bits in the
   key (even if the list wasn't quite complete, it would not be hard to
   search for keys with one additional bit, two additional bits, etc.)
   Someone who exchanged messages daily would have their public key
   compromised well within a year.


This is rather better: leaking out a different set of bits in each
message, and it wouldn't take many messages to determine all the bits.

No good reason to restrict yourself to set bits either.  Use 11-bit
messages, one bit of which tells you the parity of the bit found at
the location pointed at by the remaining 10 bits.  To get the search
space down fast enough, you'd probably only leak one bit per message,
as looking for 2^11 different keys to get the pattern you want takes
time.  You then need to capture a few hundred messages generated with
that key.

Of course, all this is based on your unjustified assumption that any
given bit pattern can be generated from arbitrary plaintext and the
correct choice of key.  I'm not saying that your assumption is wrong,
just that you haven't justified it so far as I can tell.

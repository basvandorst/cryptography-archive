Ok, I used two assumptions:

1. The real strength of DES is 56 bits. This is for instance
supported by the work of Michael J. Wiener, who says that
while DES can be broken with 2^{47} known plaintexts the
most practical attack is brute force, which implies a real
key size of 56 bits. It has also been said numerous times
here on sci.crypt that the reason NSA shortened the DES
key was that this reflects the real strength of the
algorithm.

2. The complexity of an attack increases linearly with the
number of rounds if the key schedule is good. This is
supported by differential cryptanalysis in which each round
adds the same factor of complexity. By "good key schedule"
I mean that every bit of key is distributed among many
subkeys so that sections of the cipher cannot be isolated
and treated as black boxes (meet in the middle attack).

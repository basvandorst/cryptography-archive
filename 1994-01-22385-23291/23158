The 1/24/94 Washington Post announced the opening of the NSA crypto
museum.  The Post said it had actually been open to the public for a
little while but they didn't initially announce the opening to the press
for fear of their people's photographs being published.

The museum covers up to about 1974, with some exceptions like a 1983
Cray.  They have items such as Enigma machines and the bugged carved
plaque given to the US embassy.

It's in Fort Meade, Maryland: East on MD-32 from I-295, "behind the
Shell station", in a former motel.  9-3 m-f.

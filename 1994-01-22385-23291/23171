With a good cryptosystem, if someone gives you a black box which encrypts
or decrypts whatever you feed into it, you should not be able to ascertain
anything useful about the system without "breaking open" the box; if they
take the box away you should no longer be able to encrypt/decrypt.  If a
scheme is vulnerable to DC, knowing the ciphertexts for a few carefully
selected cleartexts (or vice versa) may allow the key to be trivially
derived.  Resistance to this is important in at least two cases (one not
yet real, one very real):

-1- A "short-term" wiretap authorization is granted against a given Clipper
    chip.  The current plan is to have the escrow agents produce a black box
    which would self-destruct [logically at least] after a certain period of
    time.  If during this time the FBI or whomever could feed it plaintexts
    which would compromise the key, the "short-term" of the wiretap would be
    voided.

-2- If an agency uses "black boxes" to do its crypto, it would naturally like
    to know at all times where all useable black boxes are.  If the code that
    is buried in a black box is resistant to DC (and the box is tamper-proof)
    one can be sure that no boxes have been smuggled out for analysis and then
    smuggled back in undetected.

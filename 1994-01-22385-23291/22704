(Disclaimer: I'm not a USA citizen, so most of this discussion (and the whole
Clipper issue) is none of my affair, except for _my_ government's tendency to
adopt USA technology). Anyway, rule #1 in military intelligence is that you
judge a `not-friendly' by its _capabilities_, not by its _intentions_. This
tends to clear up matters, which is useful. We had a bad experience in 73, for
example, when some people ignored this rule... BTW, `not-friendly' in this
case is anyone you are not 100% certain of, and this category includes any
government I ever heard of, past and present (and I'm willing to lay any money
on a bet that in the future as well).

Well, it is interesting to note that the American constitution was written
such that almost exactly these views David shows as extremist were initially
built into the original version:

Weapons - originally, there was no limit to the arsenal kept by private
citizens. I understand that in fact citizens did own weapons equivalent to
those of the government, e.g. cannons. This is not quite a disarmed
government, just a government that is outgunned by the people, but still...
Only later was this eroded to deny private citizens the ownership of anything
above a certain effectiveness, and this tendency seems ongoing (e.g., the
Brady Law).

IRS, economic reports, FBI etc. - I dimly recall that the _existence_ of the
IRS required a change in the constitution (somebody correct me here if I'm
wrong, _please_) as a national income tax was unconstitutional. I don't know
about the FBI but I think it is a rather recent agency (i.e., did not exist at
the first decades (century?) of the USA's existence).

So the founding fathers did do their best to reduce the _capability_ of the
government to abuse its power. My history books consider this as one of the
great achievements of statecraft _because of this exact reason_.

Now to the issue of Clipper. It seems that a widespread _reliance_ on
Clipper/Capstone, achieved in whatever way, gives the government an
unprecedented capability to tap almost everybody, simultaneously and
automatically. Given reasonable development in speech recognition and even the
current state of the art I would say that both data _and_ voice could be
automatically analyzed in a grand scale (given the appropriate investment in
equipment and the availability of the keys). In addition to this grand
tapping, Clipper/Capstone gives the government the capability to tap any group
or single citizen at will.

Clarification: I am talking about people actually using Clipper/Capstone as
their means to achieve secure communications. Tricks such as additional
encryption do not count. This is what makes the situation above different then
the current one - today most traffic is clear, but for a secure channel people
use a multitude of methods. Obviously clear traffic is subject to the above
attack, which is why some people advocate encrypting _all_ traffic.

Note that it does not matter how the Clipper/Capstone popularity is achieved.
Subsidizing it heavily. Requiring it on government contracts. Taxing other
crypto usage on public networks. Zillions of other subtle ways - Governments
have many ways of making people and companies cooperate, not all of which
include blatant laws.

Now, the USA public may elect to grant the government these capabilities given
that it promises to `behave itself'. In which case there will be two grand
empires ending in a very unexpected manner this century, not just one :-)
Really, `read my lips: we promise ...' is a very flimsy basis for such a
concession.

From this I gather you consider the government 100% trustworthy (at least, not
subject to rule #1 above). I agree such a view would make it hard to discuss
anything political with most people.

Hypothetical: government suggests implanting a locator in each citizen.
Continuous traces of the location of each citizen are collected but can only
be decrypted/made available by court order. Each person can use the locator to
summon the police. Likewise if he suffers a severe medical damage, an
ambulance is summoned automatically. Parents can also locate their kids (up to
age 6, say). System is announced as voluntary, and is dirt cheap (subsidized).
Query: is it a good thing? It seems to me you would say it is. If not, please
explain the line of reasoning that makes Clipper a good thing and this a
horrible nightmare.

(I'm scared for a moment he'll bite the bullet and say it _is_ a good idea. It
_is_ achievable using today's technology, you know... In fact I read an
article about employee auto-location in company buildings... extrapolate a few
years or decades ahead... shudder).

Again, apologies for interfering in the internal policies of a foreign country,
and for any mish-mash I made of your history, may you have much more of it :-)

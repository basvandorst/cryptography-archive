How would this motivate Congress?  The technology you mention is already
available to Americans such as themselves.  What would motivate a
Congress-critter to share this technology with other countries, whose
citizens can't vote to re-elect them?

The only approach that I can see that would work is to make a case that
crypto is potentially a big job creator, and that allowing export would
create significantly more jobs for their constituents.  In that respect, I
can't see that crypto is labor intensive enough to appeal to a politician on
that basis.  The only other benefit would be improving our balance of trade
picture by exporting this technology.  Anyone know what the potential
overseas market would be?

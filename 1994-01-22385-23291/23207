The Poles originally cracked an Enigma in the early 1930s.  However,
shortly before the war the Germans made significant changes that the
Poles could not cope with.  The British were able to crack Enigma, but
only after recieving one vital piece of information - the wiring between
the keyboard/lamps (via the Steckerbrett on the Army/Air Force Enigma) to
the entry wheel (where the contacts were made with the rotating wheels).
The Polish method essentially was to program an electro-mechanical 'bomba'
with information about a crib and some ciphertext - and let it exhaustively
search for a matching Enigma configuration.  The British versions were
called 'bombe'.  As the Germans developed new variants the British
cryptographers were kept very busy.

Sorry, you have several errors here - I hope this is not too long, and
that it helps distinguish Enigma, Geheimschreiber, etc ...

'Ultra' consisted of two parts:

Enigma
This was used to manually encipher/decipher messages - typing a key and
noteing the lamp that lit.  Then transmitting the message in morse,
(intercepted communications being mostly those sent by radio).  Enigma
was used in the field, eg within armies.  There were different versions
used by Army/Air Force, Navy, Abwehr, German Railways, ...  using
different equipment configurations, some with extra wheel positions, some
with further wheels to select from, ...  Cracking was facilitated by lax
German misuse of Enigma, eg sending standard format weather reports, common
message openings, ...


Teleprinter transmissions (British codename 'Fish')
Two systems were cracked by Ultra, they were important because they were
used for conveying strategic information between Berlin and the Generals
in the field.  The first was the German Army's use of Lorenz SZ 40, and
SZ 42 (Schlusselzusatz), which was placed between the teleprinter and the
radio/telegraph-line.  This was introduced in mid-1941, and understood and
targeted by Bletchley in January 1942, (code named 'Tunny').  The other was
the Siemens T 52, (Geheimschreiber - 'secret writer') - a teleprinter which
incorporated the encryption/decryption, introduced by the Air Force later
in 1941.  Although this was understood by the summer of 1942 (codenamed
'Sturgeon') it was not targetted.  Partly because this would deflect
resources from cracking Tunny, and also because Enigma was already providing
information about the Air Force whilst the Army's Enigma was much more
resistant.
Tunny used a Vernam cipher, and early analysis was performed with the
'Heath Robinson'.  When this demonstrated a possibility of cracking
Tunny, the Collossus machines were built and used to automate cryptanalysis.


I hope I that I have not mangled the facts too much.  For more details I
suggest the book of essays I'm reading, and found all this in: "Codebreakers
- The Inside Story of Bletchley Park", Edited by H.F. Hinsley & Alan Stripp,
Oxford University Press 1993, ISBN 0-19-820327-6

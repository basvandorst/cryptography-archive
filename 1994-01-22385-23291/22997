That's actually a very cute trick, even if it's totally useless.
One thing to point out if anyone still thinks that might prove
some danger to RSA:  The described method can take approximately
n steps, but the most entirely stupid factoring algorithm you can
think of takes only square_root(n) steps.  In other words, the
proposed method is lots worse than even the worst previously proposed
technique (and both are highly unpractical).

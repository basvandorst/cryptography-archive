I am working on a technique for analyzing pubic key protocols.
I would like to test it out on some new protocols. So far it
does okay with protocols that have known flaws, but I want to
try it out on some new ones. If you have a public key protocol
that you believe is secure, but can't prove it, I would 
welcome the chance to take a crack at it. I'd especially be
interested in any published protocols that you think might
have a weakness, but you haven't been able to find it. As soon
as I get all the odds and ends put together, I will put out a
report with my method so you can try it as well.

Thanks a lot,
Avi Rubin

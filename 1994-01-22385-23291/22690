Short of embarking on some lecturing on the subject I would suggest that
you go back to the original paper by Rivest et al. You can construct RSA
system using both primes and pseudoprimes. The restriction on e is, as in
the previous message, (e,ph(N))=1. Here N=P*Q and phi is a totient function.
The decrypting exponent is computed as follows: e*D=1(mos(phi(N)). The problem
under discussion is how to factor N when the latter is a pseudoprime or is
a factor in such a number.Correction: e*d=1(mod(phi(N)).

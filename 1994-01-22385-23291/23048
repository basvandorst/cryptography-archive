The primary problem with use a more gutsy encryption method is that this
needs to be exportable, and we had a desire to be able to export the
mastering system so overseas affiliates could create their own disks.  It
doesn't make any difference anyway; as long as the cost of breaking the key
is more expensive than the cost of attaining the software in some other way
(buying it or pirating it through other channels) the software is "secure
enough".  When it's primarily a channel for software costing well under a
thousand dollars, you're less concerned about people throwing a hundred
thousand CPU hours at the problem or an experienced cryptographer spending
a couple of weeks on it.  The system is still vunerable to someone stealing
the final decryption key at the lowest level of the software (as I believe
all CD-ROM distribution schemes are), but the value of doing so is
seriously blunted by the existence of multiple pressings of the CD, each
encrypted with different keys; will the average pirate go to the trouble of
reverse-engineering the software to steal the key, then producing a program
which can extract the software given that key if the key is only going to
be useful to one person in 10? one in 20? one in 100?  It's my suspicion
that Joe Pirate will more likely just upload the software itself.  (This is
all after Joe bought the software in the first place.)  The hope in
designing the system was to keep the effort and cost required to steal
software from the CD higher than the effort and cost required to buy the
software from a retail outlet and upload the actual software. In that
respect, I believe it is successful.

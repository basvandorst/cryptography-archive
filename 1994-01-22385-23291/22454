I assume not good enough, based on my reading of the fundamental policy
issues with repect to the protection of our economic communications, and the
fact that RSA and IDEA aren't going to be outlawed by Clipper. If Clipper
were really this "evil" proposal many make it out to be, the government
would have acted already with respect to RSA and IDEA, instead of not, and
instead of saying they won't. If the government felt RSA and IDEA were
secure against well-endowed economic adversaries (and I must assume the NSA
knows a lot more about this than I do), they would not have bothered with
Clipper. It would have been far simpler and cheaper to require the deposit
of keys to existing systems in an "escrow".

As you'd know if you followed these discussions, I announced that I had
repudiated the "B" key in 1992, right after I learned of the legal
controversies surrounding PGP, and had destroyed my copy of the software.
Some "not fully informed person" brings this up regularly and I've publicly
replied equally regularly.

As to the 1993 "5C" key, that is bogus and I've issued no PGP keys since the
repudiated 9/24/1992 one.

Here's another issue you don't seem to understand. Go back and reread my
message about profitability of one, two or no versions. It had nothing to do
with easy or cheap, which is a straw man you guys raised.

So much noise to try to refute a self-evident statement--that an assertion
that something is impractical is refuted by the profitable existence of that
something.

As for your assertions that I don't know anything about complex software
packages, debugging, or the release process, I was writing Fortran at IBM
in the 1950's when you were likely still eating baby food.

You mean the type of terrorist that might, say, rent a truck for
a bombing in his own name?  Obviously someone smart enough to use
another algorithm than Clipper.

I agree that Clipper is ill-intentioned, but don't be too surprised at the
ability of the government to sell it's reasonabbly legitamate characteristics
to fight crime.  Look how many criminals are doing deals with cellular phones,
which are much more easily tapped, and widely known to be easily tapped, 
than Clipper phones would be.

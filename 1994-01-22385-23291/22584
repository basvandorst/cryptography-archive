  But it can't be, it is always used twice in this scheme.  The
security definitely depends on the public key system used, and may be
much weaker than the PK system.  For example, if the pk system and the
otp system both use xoring with the message, you trivially have:

     A) OTP xor PK bit-stream
     B) OTP xor message

     A xor B) message xor PK bit-stream
     
    So the "extra" traffic hasn't gained anything as long as both
transmissions use insecure channels.

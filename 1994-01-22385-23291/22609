As a California resident, I'd never heard this.  Can you
cite the applicable section of law?  Otherwise, this sounds like one of
those "Urban Legends".  How are they going to know about your "illegal
locks" until they're ready to arrest you a more serious charge, anyway?

If anything, I'd think that such regulations would more properly related to
fire safety and allowing firemen to enter your home in an emergency.  Nor is
the length of the bolt, let's say, necessarily more important than the
construction of the door and frame themselves.

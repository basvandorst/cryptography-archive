My apologies for coming in late to this discussion, and for introducing
a (slight) irrelevancy.  Folks interested in the legal status of digital
signatures may want to look at Patrick Brown's paper on the subject
in the recent Fairfax conference.  While many of the specific citations
are to American law and precedent, a fair amount of the discussion is
based on common law, which is largely shared between the U.S. and the U.K.

The paper does not address the problems that Ross Anderson brought up,
of the admissibility and authenticity of any such evidence.  According
to the lawyers with whom I've spoken, admissibility (at least in the
U.S.) is rarely much of an issue, barring obvious problems or fraud,
and computer-generated records -- like any other sort of evidence --
can be attacked as fraudulent or erroneous.

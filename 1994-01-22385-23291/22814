Has anyone purchased the Mobey Crypto system?  If so, what did you think 
of the code you received?  Why did you get it?

As far as I can tell, it is a bunch of source code for encryption and 
decryption.  It includes PGP 2.3 (which I can get from sites for free).
Does it include other things that are pub dom?

What makes it worth the asking price of $150.00?

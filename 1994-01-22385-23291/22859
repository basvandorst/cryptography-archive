As was pointed out in another thread on a.s.pgp, by signing your own
key, you verify that you hold the corresponding secret key.  Also, in
PGP, the signature on the key includes the ID string. Hence, no one
can edit the key's ID without making all presently attached signature
invalid.  A public key signed with its own secret key is
"self-checking" in the sense that, whoever gave the key its ID *must*
hold the corresponding secret key.

Just be sure to verify (by fingerprints or whatever) that the key
belongs to the name on the ID.

The moral: Sign your own key.

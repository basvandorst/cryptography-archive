Can someone point me to this discussion or to the section of the ITAR or
to a memo from NSA or whatever that disallows hooks for crypto routines?
I've heard this claim several times, and I can't see how they could
make it stand up, other than by intimidation.

On stereo sets, there are usually some jacks labeled "TAPE IN" and "TAPE OUT."
You can use them to hook in a tape deck, or you can use them to hook in
a sound processor (graphic equalizer), or you can use them to hook up
a CD player or a television set or a microphone preamplifier.

The same thing applies to hooks.  We put exit points in our products for
our customers to use at their whim.  Sure, most of them have suggested
uses, but the customers can use them for whatever they want; it's their
system.

So, suppose we put in an exit that is just where you would want to hook
in your crypto routine.  Is that prohibited?  What if we meant it for
some other purpose and the customer decided to hook in the crypto routine
there?  Does our intent make a difference?

And if the exits are prohibited, because they could be used for crypto, is
the next step banning the export of all computers (I understand that some
actually are controlled) because they could be used to run a crypto
program?

By the way, in case I wasn't clear above (I wasn't) when I say *prohibited*,
I mean *prohibited from export without an export license...*.  I realise
that there is, so far, no domestic prohibition.

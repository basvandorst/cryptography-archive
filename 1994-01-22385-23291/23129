The Clipper chips do not perform any sort of key exchange.  This has to
be arranged externally to the chips themselves, and the keys then loaded
in.  So, you can put a couple of Clippers in the middle of a link, but
all you will accomplish is to scramble the data.  Unless you have gotten
the key some other way.  Now it's possible that a certain Clipper product
will use some poor method of key exchange which will allow this attack,
but that's a problem with the product, not Clipper.

The Capstone chip does perform some type of key exchange.  In the
brochure I have, it is only referred to as "Public Key Exchange up to
1024 bits".  I would guess that this may be Diffie-Helman, but I'm not
sure.  It is my understanding that D-H can be secure against man in the
middle attacks.  If I'm wrong here, I'm sure that I'll be corrected.

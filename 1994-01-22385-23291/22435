	There is a book entitled "Embedded Controller Forth for
the 8051 Family" whose author is William H Payne, aka Bill Payne.
I found this information by anonymous ftp to asterix.inescn.pt
in /pub/forth/8051/read51.txt, in case you wanted to know.
	This doesn't tell us much, just that WHPayne is not some
unknown to the computer field, and that he does have some experience
in getting published.  It also tells us that he is a Forth programmer.
	Can someone take a look at Payne's book and give us their
impression of it?  It's not related to cracking RSA in any way, but
there might be something there worth noting, some insight into
Payne and/or his work.

The RSA-129 project has now passed the half-way stage by a significant
margin.  I estimate that we are about 60% completed.  The state of
play as of 0600UT 21 January 1994 is as follows:

We have 5171986 relations processed at hot-spare.mit.edu, the central
collecting site.  This total is made up of 66729 full relations
(fuls), 870334 partial relations (pars) and 4234923 double partial
relations (pprs).  The fuls are useful as they stand.  The pars and
pprs (collectively known as paprs) must be combined into "cycles".  At
the moment, they generate 88388 cycles.  When the sum (cycles + fuls)
reaches 524400 we have virtually finished.  The current sum is 155117.

Although 155117/524400 = 0.2958, we are more than 30% completed,
because cycles become ever more common as paprs are added to the
collection.  We predict that we will need about 9 million paprs in
total, based on experience with previous factorizations and on a least
squares fit to the data gathered so far.

To illustrate how much progress we have made, a month ago we had
3490714 relations, 45350 fuls and 27609 cycles, a total of 72959.  I
then estimated that we had about 40% of the total required.

We are still getting about 40-45 thousand relations per day through
the mail (15 megabytes of email per diem), with extra material being
received by ftp at irregular intervals.  During the Xmas and New Year
holidays, we were often sent in excess of 50k relations per day.

I have made a few calculations on just how big a project this is.  To
date, we have used around 2500 mips-years.  That is 3 times the
present record holder for a completed factorization.  It corresponds
to very nearly 10**17 machine instructions.  It is a significant
fraction of all the machine instructions ever executed in all history,
perhaps one part in a few million.  We may well be performing the
biggest single computation ever.

Once again, we'd like to thank our contributors for their cooperation,
patience when things go wrong and assistance in debugging the problems
which inevitable arise when something of this magnitude is undertaken.
We'd like to thank the many individuals and organizations who have
donated their spare machine cycles by the billions and trillions.


Summary:  5171986 relations, 60% done.
	  66729 fuls, 870334 pars, 4234923 pprs, 88388 cycles

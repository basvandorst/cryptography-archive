   It is my understanding that the databooks should be available now, and
   the chips may be also.  Get a hold of Myko and ask.  The Capstone is
   model number MYK-80.  The Clipper comes in three flavors: MYK-78E,
   MYK-78T, and MYK-77.  They are nice people at Myko; I'm sure they will be
   glad to help you.  Don't forget to ask for information on there other
   products ;-).

That's interesting - can you summarize the difference between Clipper flavors?
Are they different speeds, or is one of them 3.3 volts or something?
		Thanks!

No current generation drives could have their data extracted effectively 
with this method.  Track and linear densities have gotten so high that the 
linear bit cell is below the optical diffraction limit for visible light.
While some data patterns could probably still be discerned, others would only
be limited to some subset of patterns.   Basically, extracting information 
from magnetic discs using optical methods has gotten much more difficult, and
in some cases impossible.

   Nothing wrong with that, but I should have named names.  I was
referring to the original poster, Colin James III.  I have no idea how
much you know about cryptography, (or how much you think you know
about it ;-) and I apologize for posting something that could be
misunderstood in sci.crypt.  (The article recieved no attention on
comp.lang.ada.  Colin is by now well known there.)

    There is a challenge, and it will probably be solved this year.
But the amount of effort required to do that, and the fact that the
challenge has survived for over 15 years should be taken as an
affirmation of RSA's security, not of a possible compromise.

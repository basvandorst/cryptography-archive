The point is the signature system, key and document management, must
be demonstrated to the court to be secure.

Suppose I have a 'signed' document from a transatlantic correspondent
called Bill, signed with (say) PGP.  For the signature on that document
to be recognised I would likely need to prove the signature was generated
with Bill's private key, and that only Bill could have done so.

So I explain RSA public key signatures.  Then I have to prove that the
public key I claim is Bill's actually came from him, and is not a key
I created with his email address attached.  Hopefully the key is signed
by 'introducers' of good character.  However if Bill used PGP on a
multiuser system, or didn't set a password on his private key, or claims
either of these, then I have real problems in holding Bill to our
agreement.


OTOH in British courts I can't see any problem is signing a computer audit
file with PGP, and (using PGP to verify the signature) testifying that it
is valid and accurate, in the same way I can for printed or written documents.
(I believe the rules on computer evidence were relaxed a little last year).

So what. It's resolved now. The statement I made is thus true and your

You need to exercise more self-restraint in both your choice of Subject and
your text when it is your ignorance that is the problem. There was much
additional material from the government since the original protocols. I rely
on the quotations of that material posted in alt.security.clipper,
sci.crypt, comp.org.eff.talk, etc. I have no collateral information not
available to diligent readers here.

The amplifying material from the government was that the escrow segments
would only be made available via a black box, and the expiry date of the
court orders would also be entered there. The traffic could only be
decrypted by law enforcement agencies via that black box. The box
automatically trashes the key when the expiry date arrives. I assume that
the box will be just as tamper-proof as the Mycotronix chip (extensive
descriptions of the physical and electronic safeguards in that chip have
been recited here).

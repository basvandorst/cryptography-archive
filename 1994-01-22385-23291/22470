What assumptions?
By "evidently" I meant purely on the evidence of their words.

What in the name of heaven or hell might "a crypto or policy expert" know
about the subject at hand, building software?  While someone at
berkeley.edu might not have much direct experience shipping software,
"a crypto or policy expert" is unlikely to know how to spell "C" and 
generally be as useful as ... well, let's keep this superfically polite.

Anyone who claims that building multiple releases of non-trivial software
is easy or cheap or even generally practical is obviously ignorant of the
facts of life in the business as it is practiced in the last decades of
the 20th century.  Arguing with people like me on this subject is as silly
as someone like me arguing with the greenest Congressman on what
compromises are really required to get anything done in Washington today.

Note that Mr. Pope has mentioned his software release experience is related
to embedded controllers.  I've done that too, and it is incomparably
different from releasing a large software system.  Like many "real life"
things, the differences are so huge it is probably necessary to experience
them to comprehend.

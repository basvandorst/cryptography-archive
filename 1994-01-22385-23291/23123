PowerTalk is part of Apple's recently-introduced Apple Open Collaborative
Environment (AOCE), it's included in the System 7 Pro package, and provides
document integrity and author verification through registered digital
signatures.

But I don't understand exactly what happens inside nor how it interacts
with the rest of the world.  Is it conceivably compatible with PEM?  Are
other folks coming out with enhancements for encrypting documents rather
than the pretty limited built-in signing feature?

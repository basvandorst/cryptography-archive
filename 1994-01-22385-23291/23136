No sooner do you have a really-truely RNG than you have to start writing
down the sequence of random numbers (typically we find that someone else
needs them).

In that case there is very little practical difference between the
"real thing" and a pseudo-random generator (apart from the fact
the pseudo-random article can give you a few more distributions
than something attached to physical laws).

In any case, how fast are gas discharge tubes? My guestimate would
be (since you mention a lottery) not REAL fast; a pseudo-RNG can
give you Mb per second.

Just my $.03 worth (at AUD = .67 USD).

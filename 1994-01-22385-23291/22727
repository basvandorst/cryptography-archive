While this discussion about what electronic evidence may constitute an
admissable evidence in court is surely interesting to the US or UK readers,
it is worth mentioning that these two countries form an exception in their
law practice.
In all European countries except the UK (may be other exceptions, but I don't
know any), _ANY_ proof is admissible in court. The jury/judge has to decide
how much weight to put on any piece of evidence for the final decission.
Thus, the questions related to electronic evidence are related to
determination of the reliability of the evidence with respect to its
correctness, not whether it may be used at all. While there is still a
need to establish firm rules here, the problems should be easier to solve
than the US/UK problems.

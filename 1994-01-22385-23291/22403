In _Applied Cryptography_, page 98, Bruce Schneier gives an "oblivious
transfer" protocol which apparently requires disclosure of both of Alice's
messages before Bob can be certain that Alice has not cheated by sending
one message twice. "After the protocol is complete and both possible
results of the transfer are known, Alice must give Bob her private keys so
that he can verify that she did not cheat.  After all, she could have
encrypted the same message with both keys in step (4)."

He also mentions that there are other protocols, but I don't have easy
access to the publications.

On page 103, he gives a "Digital Certified Mail" protocol which requires an
oblivious transfer protocol that does not make the above disclosure, since
it must be "complete" (so that Bob knows that Alice has not cheated) at a
point where it is still necessary that Bob not know both messages.

Can someone give an oblivious transfer protocol which is suitable for use
with this Digital Certified Mail protocol?

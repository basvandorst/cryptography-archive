  Myself, I save the PGP encrypted e-mail, download it, and run PGP on it
with my PC. It may be a little inconvienent at times, but it works! I
don't trust the security of any UNIX system.. especially since chmod won't
stop the sysadmin from getting at your files. (And since he's the
sysadmin, he dan do anything.) Since I know I am the lord and master of
my PC at home, I'll only use it for decrypting/encrypting messages.

   Regards,

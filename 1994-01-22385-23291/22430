Well, they got ATT to change the design of their secure phone to use
Skipjack and now ATT won't use anything else (at the present time).  So
government intervention has already had an impact on the market even if it 
all ends up gathering 'dust on the shelves'.

What bothers me is the intent of the government's intervention.  Sternlight
argues we should be happy we are getting a really secure algorythm for the
world's leading crypto experts.  And maybe we are...but we will never have
any confidence beyond 'trust us'.

But I don't think anyone believes the government's main intent is to provide
secure crypto.  Rather it is to provide situationally controlled insecure
crypto.  

The escrow proposals to provide this situational control hinge on a number
of relatively distrubing points.  

One example: all the protections I have seen in the escrow proposals are
aimed at attempting to continue at least some protection of domestic
communications.  But traditionally 'agencies of the government' have felt
they have unrestricted access to international communications.  I assume
this means they expect to be given Skipjack keys anytime they are necessary
to read any international communication.

If 'agencies of the government' have this backdoor into Skipjack, they don't
need a trapdoor!

But, bottom line, what bothers me is this is a proposal from our government
for implementation of what is really a privacy reduction technology :(

I wish we were headed in the opposite direction.  Privacy used to be one
of the community values that identified Americans.

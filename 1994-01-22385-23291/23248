for weaker cryptosystems, differential cryptanalysis is practical
in some situations.  but even in those cases where it isn't, which
would you take:  cryptosystem A, which is resistant, or cryptosystem
B, which is not?

that B can fall to a differential crypto attack in some oddball
mode that might never be useful in the Real World simply
indicates it has *some* statistical weakness somewhere.  of course,
this doesn't imply A lacks such a thing either...

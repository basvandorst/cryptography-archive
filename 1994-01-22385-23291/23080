I have found when trying to scribble over something I have written, that
writing another message over the stuff I want to cross out ( or even 2
or 3 messages) is far far more efficient than crodsing it out or jusr
scribbling over it. It is very difficult to disentangle the two
meaningful messages from each other.
0s an 1s are like crossing out.

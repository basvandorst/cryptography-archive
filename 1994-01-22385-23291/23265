:In what way inconsistent?  Enigma was used to encipher signals sent by
:morse.  The Lorenz SZ40 & SZ42 were used to encipher Teleprint messages,
:ie BAUDOT code to/from a teletype with punched tape, keyboard & print
:unit.  Although it does sound a little exaggerated, computing time on the
:Colossus was very valuable - when the wheel setting were found for a
:message the decryption was performed with a 'tunny', allowing the Colossus
:to be used on another message.

   Thank you!  There's the piece of information I didn't have.  The original
posting didn't mention the punched-tape output of the Lorenz machines.  Also,
the wording suggested that Colossus was never used for direct decryption
(though it didn't say that explicitly).
   I never agreed OR disagreed with Colossus' connection (or lack thereof)
to Enigma, BTW.

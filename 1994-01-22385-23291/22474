I am content to let Steve Brinich's latest message (just prior to this one
in the thread) stand without detailed comment. I see nothing in his
arguments that invalidate my own, and readers, having seen both sets of
comments are free to draw their own conclusions.

This isn't win/lose and I'm not keeping score, nor do I think Steve is.

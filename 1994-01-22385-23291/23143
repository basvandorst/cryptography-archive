Using a radioactive source as described above, the count of particles
emmited in a given time period will be a random number albeit not
uniformly distributed. In fact, the values will follow a Poisson
distribution. This can fairly easily be transformed to an uniform
distribution. However, I wonder if that is really needed.

Apart from the issue of Poisson vs uniform distributions, I agreee
this is the major issue.

David, this is all well and good assuming that the feederal government,
or more appropriate, one of its thre-lettered-agencies, actually followed
the letter of the established law.

instances where this (authorization) has not happened.

That disregard for the law, David, exists within intelligentsia, and that,
is what most learned individuals fear.

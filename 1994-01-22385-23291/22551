   still sell to most of the market.

Again, that's not as easy as you make it out.  A truly secure machine
must never store unencrypted data in mass storage, or (more importantly)
send it over a network.  Retrofitting a crypto system into the
filesystem or network layer is not trivial even with source; without
source it's well-nigh impossible.  One doesn't "add" security to a
system; one designs it in in the first place.

Anyway, for mass storage or network purposes, hardware encryption is
needed, and I won't get into the issues of retrofitting THAT.

   I know what I'm talking about here, having been the victim of industrial
   espionage on 3 different projects valued at a billion dollars (no typo)
   each. Fortunately, the perpetrators were also American companies and the
   government told them if they didn't knock it off they'd be disqualified. In
   the end we won all three. I believe this wouldn't have happened had the
   competitor been foreign and encouraged and maybe even aided, rather than
   discouraged by their governments in committing such economic espionage.

Remember that the original Clipper proposal did not rule out giving
escrowed keys to foreign governments for crime fighting purposes.

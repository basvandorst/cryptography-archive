   This is pretty close to what I've seen.  A couple definitions I've seen
from (not entirely reliable) memory:
 
1.  The bit sequence is pseudorandom if there exists no polynomial-time
    algorithm that can tell the sequence from a random one.
 
2.  The bit sequence is pseudorandom if, given all previous bits in the
    stream, the next bit can't be predicted better than .5 prob. by any
    polynomial-time algorithm.
 
   I think these are functionally equivalent.

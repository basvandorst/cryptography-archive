What kind of transposition did you have in mind?  Bit or byte?  The
same transposition for each instance of "tran"?  

Let me state right out that I don't believe there is a trapdoor in the
DES.  To me, a trapdoor is asking for something too clever to detect
while still being effective, in other words, practically a belief in
magic.  If it's gonna be effective, it must leave discernible traces.

However, I'm quite interested in your idea of interposing transpositions.

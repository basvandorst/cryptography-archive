that's funny, whenever there is an article in the media about the cypherpunks,
they talk about T.C.May,E.Hughes, and J.Gilmore as the Leaders. They were in
the Wired pictures and the front cover too.

some cypherpunks leaders have talked out against PGP.

I don't get it. Is T.C.May a leader or not? if he is not, why is he always
in the media articles? why do you pay attention to him? why does he have
a fan club on the list? if so, why do you claim you don't listen to him?
very confusing around here lately.

many cypherpunks promote black marketeering, tax evasion, money laundering
etc. under the guise of `privacy'. B.Stewart is one such person. Please
indicate whether you are in favor of this. (Note that T.C.May is the leader
of this radical, extremist, subversive agenda-- just look at his signature!)

MD5 was developed after Bert den Boer and Antoon Bosselaers did present some
weakness of the MD4 algorithm. Though not "really broken" the security of MD4
seems to be very doubtfull. I did not find the reference yet, but I vagely
remember that it was Bert den Boer himself, who now found collisions in MD5.

Probably it is not a good idea to construct any cryptographic function by
"improving" another cryptographic function, which security is doubtful, as
Ron Rivest did when developing MD5 from MD4

I find all this discussion of who exported what insane.

Every day, people spread pirated programs.  Some prolly encrypted with PGP,
some not.  (PGP is not at fault here -- it's doing it's job.  The user is to
blame)

If I were an informed investigator, I'd find some random computer hacker who
knows a bit of IRC and have them see how much data they can collect.  I bet
this person would collect 100 meg in short order of copyright violations and
encryption software.  Hell, anything goes on IRC these days.

(for those who are unfamiliar with IRC, it stands for Internet Relay Chat,
with some more colorful acronyms used by some of us.  :)  It is a real-time
chat program, which allows many people all over the Internet to talk to many
others.  File transfer is not directly supported through IRC, but IRC can be
used to make arrangements for such.)

Just my opinions, no one else's.

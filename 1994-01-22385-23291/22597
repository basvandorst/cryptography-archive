This is my first day on SCI.CRYPT, and I felt like nagging you all a bit. I
suppose my question isn't that cryptographically strong :), but anyway,

How do I decrypt standard CRC32's?

I posted this question on ALT.SECURITY previously but all they could really
tell me was that it was possible <SIGH>

Some info from a sourcecode I grabbed:

; First, the polynomial itself and its table of feedback terms.  The
; polynomial is
; X^32+X^26+X^23+X^22+X^16+X^12+X^11+X^10+X^8+X^7+X^5+X^4+X^2+X^1+X^0
;
; Note that we take it "backwards" and put the highest-order term in
; the lowest-order bit.  The X^32 term is "implied"; the LSB is the
; X^31 term, etc.  The X^0 term (usually shown as "+1") results in
; the MSB being 1.

            That's it!

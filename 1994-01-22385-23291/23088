That should have read: 

As far as I know, it is impossible to reverse crypt() encrypted passwords.

After some reading of man pages I found notes on how crypt() (or some
versions of it at least)uses DES to encrypt the password, taking the
key from the low order 7 bits of the text (after salting) and then
taking the resultant DES'd string and DESing it again twice more using
the same method of generating the key (ie: low order 7 bits of the
DES'd string).

The point being, that the key to the middle-stage DES encryption
is lost in the final encryption, therefore its impossible to reverse
engineer the algorythym without the key, which is lost and unknown,
therefore guessing keys is the only option.

Is this a correct interpretation?  Or close to correct :)

Cheers

   Yes, the amount of computation is very impressive.  However, I don't
   think it's a record if you count things like phased-array radar
   systems (used for looking over the horizon for incoming missiles).
   These do massive numbers of signal processing operations and operate
   for years... I think synthetic aperture radars used on military
   airplanes effectively crunch even more numbers, using optical
   analog computers of some kind... I wonder if such techniques could
   ever be applied to this kind of discrete computation.


I agree.  That's why I said "single computation".  Yes, I am aware
that term is ambiguous.

The reduction of the Hipparcos data set to a globally consistent set
of co-ordinates is also a massive task, and could be regarded as a
"single computation".  However, I think that that computation won't be
finished for a year or two yet.  I do not know how it compares to the
RSA-129 factorization.

Processing the Magellan radar data was pretty compute-intensive, but
I'd regard that as more of a large collection of admittedly related
computations.  I'm happy to be convinced otherwise.

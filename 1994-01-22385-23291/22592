Clipper is to be used in cellular and cordless phones.  People with the
right receivers can pick up transmissions.  And it's trivial in these War on
Drugs days to say `an anonymous informant claimed...' and get a warrant to
steal someone's house, let alone a wiretap.

*Very* tricky.

And you think that the functions of the black box handed out to local sheriffs
can't be duplicated on an NSA computer, or dedicated circuitry?  Great,
they've got a system that stops cops being naughty whilst giving the NSA the
freedom to do whatever they like should they somehow manage to bypass escrow.
Better than nothing, but not good enough.

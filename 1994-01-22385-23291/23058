Maybe this has been discussed before, but what are your plans for the
final 524400(+) x 524400 reduction over GF(2)? This is substantially
larger than those I have heard of so far. The final reduction (on under
200000 unknowns) in the NFS attack on F_9 was far from straighforward,
wasn't it? Do you have access to a machine with 30 GB of RAM?

The discrete log problem has been solved for relatively small modulus
sizes, or for larger non-prime moduli.  I don't know of anything major
prior to 1989; however, you may want to look at

@article{nfscrack,
   author = {Brian A. LaMacchia and Andrew M. Odlyzko},
   journal = {Designs, Codes, and Cryptography},
   pages = {46--62},
   title = {Computation of Discrete Logarithms in Prime Fields},
   volume = {1},
   year = {1991},
}

for a description of how the instantiation that Sun uses for secure RPC
was solved.  (That's a 192 bit modulus.)  Odlyzko is here at AT&T Bell
Laboratories.  You may also want to look at

@article{Brickell88,
   author = {Ernest F. Brickell and Andrew M. Odlyzko},
   journal = {Proceedings of the IEEE},
   month = {May},
   number = {5},
   pages = {578--593},
   title = {Cryptanalysis:  A Survey of Recent Results},
   volume = {76},
   year = {1988}
}

for a good survey, though it's getting a bit dated now.

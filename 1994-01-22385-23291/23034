With respect, I don't think I'm missing the point at all.  I understand 
the theory of public key cryptography, and I understand the legal concepts
of evidentiary sufficiency.  The fact that you can verify the signature 
with a particular public key ONLY means that the message was signed with 
the matching secret key.  It doesn't prove that the secret key in fact 
"belonged" to the alleged signer, any more than the fact that a written 
signature says "Ken Bass" proves it's my signature.  You still would need 
to establish that the secret key used to sign that message was the key of 
the signer, just as you need to prove the authenticity of written signatures
that are not acknowledged to be genuine.

Remember, anyone with access to PGP/ViaCrypt can generate a keypair and 
choose what "name" to assign to it.  While the trust parameters are a 
start to verification of keys, they still depend on the integrity of third
parties, something that's not always good enough in court.

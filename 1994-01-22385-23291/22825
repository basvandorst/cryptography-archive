It seemed to me that a "natural" size for the DES, before its key was cut
to 56 bits, was a 128-bit key (like Lucifer if I remember right), and
16 S boxes of (16?) rows and columns each.  I don't have any good
reasons for this feeling, just a hunch based on symmetry.

But think of the complexity of the problem to validate S boxes of that
size!  How could you ever show that the S box values were optimally
arranged?

In other words, I wonder if the smallness of the DES were not due to
the computational difficulty of proving a larger DES, rather than NSA
skullduggery.

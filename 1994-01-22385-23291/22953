Hello,

I have a question about brute force attacks.

Let's think about a coding algorithm, that uses (theoretical) absolutly random
to encode the original text (how about thousands of special FBI agents playing
dice?). So if you encode the original the first crypt will be different from
the second and that will be different from the third ...

Of course, this crypt will take information to decode it, because it uses no
key.

Then you take a stanard encryption method, whatever you want.

Now, you join the the first (random) cryption with the second (real)
encryption. Now you got a new encryption method.

At last, you encode your text with the new method.

When the bad boys got the original text, the crypted text, and the mehtod,
i don't think, that a brute force attack would have success,
because the brute force encryption will
be surely different from the crypted text.
This is, because they can not regenerate your random sequence.

Is that correct?

What do you think about that?

Are there other cryption methods, on that a brute force will have no success?

What other possibilities of attacks remain?

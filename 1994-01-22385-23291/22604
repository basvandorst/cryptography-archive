Oh, well.  It had been a lot of fun having David Sternlight as
champion of the free market, while the EFF Spokescritters were
proposing things that verge on Socialized Networking :-)  Back to normal...

   The amplifying material from the government was that the escrow segments
   would only be made available via a black box, and the expiry date of the
   court orders would also be entered there. The traffic could only be
   decrypted by law enforcement agencies via that black box. The box
   automatically trashes the key when the expiry date arrives. I assume that
   the box will be just as tamper-proof as the Mycotronix chip (extensive
   descriptions of the physical and electronic safeguards in that chip have
   been recited here).

The closest there is to a "guarantee" from the government about any of
this is the policy statement that the Attorney General will make the
policies for government use (unless Congress steps in, of course),
which is unlikely to happen without influence from the NSA, DEA, IRS, etc.
There are four ways for government agents to get the key:
0) Change the rules - Policies set by the Attorney General can be
changed by the administration any time they feel like it, unlike
Congressional laws which tale a bit more work.
1) Non-Federal cops can ask the Federal cops for it, and are stuck
following whatever procedures the Feds impose, at least if there are
black boxes involved as opposed to handing them the key on Post-It notes.
2) Get the two half-keys from the two so-called escrow agencies,
following whatever procedures (formal or under-the-table) that requires.
3) Cheat - the procedures that Dr. Denning described for setting keys,
however unrealistic they seemed for handling 20 million keys per year,
offered half a dozen obvious ways to rip off the key without needing
the half-keys handed to the government so-called escrow agencies.
The Feds have announced that the real procedures will be different,
but there will preseumably be no fewer good ways to cheat.

Fundamentally, once somebody in the government has your keys,
they've got them until they decide to trash all their copies.
The nice thing about mathematically strong crypto is that,
unless somebody gets your keys, you can keep them from decrypting your
stuff for arbitrarily long times.  Giving your keys away breaks that.

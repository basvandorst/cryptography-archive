I'm also a crypt newbie. But I wonder... Given that your OTP needs to be at
least as long as your intended plaintext(s), your proposed scheme doesn't
add any security to the public key scheme. IOW, just send your plaintext
via your public key method. Your point about the difficulty of breaking the
PK ciphertext given a cryptographically random plaintext is good, but the
moment you send a plaintext using the OTP, I conjecture that a breaker now
has as much information about your pad as (s)he would have had if you had
sent the plaintext in the first place.

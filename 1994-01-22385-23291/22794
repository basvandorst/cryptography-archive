And it keeps going on.......

If you use the method of scrambling your key and putting it in the 
program as data, the scrambling by hand can get tedious and is prone to 
error.  On a previous reply to this thread I mentioned a trick I used to 
make a table of data.

Write a program that will scramble the key (add 3 to it, xor it, or 
convert to zip code) and output the results in a text format that is 
sorce code for your compiler.  Then this text can be pasted in the real 
program source code as data without any chance of error.

It looks as if you are well on your way.

As Virginia Reed of the Donner Party wrote,

Which looses a lot if you don't know the story of the Donner Party!

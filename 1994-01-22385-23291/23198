In regards to the UCII.EXE available on NLnet and any other ftp site. There
seems to be a problem with all off them on my machine. When I try to run the
UC2.EXE, I get this error message:

FATAL ERROR: C:\FQS\UCII.EXE is damaged

1 error has been reported 

I've download so far five EXEs from various ftp sites and I always get the
same error. I assume that there is a bug with the program that prevents it
from running on my machine properly. Anyways my config is:

i486DX/50 w/16mb RAM, ATI Ultra, UltraStor 14F (v1.1) ASPI2.3. Has UC2.EXE
been tested with PC-DOS 6.x? This is the one I've tried UC2 under and it
was run under a 1.2gb parition w/32k clusters.

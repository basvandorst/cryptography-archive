We used the "analyze" option and then the "purge" option to overwrite
the disk using format.  It left the first block of data untouched, and
did not get any data in the alternate cylinders where the bad blocks
are stored.  The Unishred Pro will overwrite these areas.

Another point is that the purge process in format uses 4 random bit
patterns to overwrite the disk.  This will not satisfy any of the
standards that have been approved by the government or military.
Unishred Pro has options built in that use a different number of
passes and bit patterns in each pass in order to satisfy disk
declassification specifications for the government or the military.

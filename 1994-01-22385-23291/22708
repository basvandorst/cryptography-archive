Actually, I retract my statement that "your argument is as good" due to
the fact that the Fourth Amendment addresses only "unreasonable" searches 
and seizures.  While it can be argued that in order for one to be "secure 
against unreasonable searches and seizures" in the case of one's 
telecommunications, unbreakable encryption must be used -- and if I were 
on a jury, I would accept this argument as valid -- it is not as clear 
cut as the content-neutrality, right to peacefully assemble, prevention 
of prior restraint and right to speak one's mind in any argot 
one chooses (cypher text), provided by the First and the Tenth Amendments.

These arguments are unbreakable.

I would like to find some documentation on the DES encryption algorithym,
the reason for this is I had a hard time convincing my house-mate
that DES is un-reverseable (ie: you can't take a DES encrypted password
and un-encrypt it by reversing the DES algoryhtm).

As far as I know, it is impossible to reverse DES encrypted passwords.

Can someone shed some light on this subject?  I would like authoritive
papers and references if possible, word-of-mouth isn't going to prove
this one :)


Cheers


Leigh

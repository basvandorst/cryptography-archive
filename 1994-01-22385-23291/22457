Excuse me?  Let's keep this polite, please.

You strike me as lacking perspective on this.

I don't notice the dual-versioning problem being a showstopper.
I notice programmers whining about the extra work, but
that's only natural.

If you will drop your tunnel vision for a moment....

*Any* regulatory environment creates
extra work that appears unnecessary ... but this is
not confined to the crypto industry by any means.

I'm not saying unnecessary regulations should not
be challenged; but dealing with regulations and
legalities is as much a part of software work as
is crafting data structures.

I suspect that either your product is more
crypto-intensive than the UNIX OS (which was the
topic of my post); or you are irritated at the
requirement not to export crypto, influencing your
opinions; or somehow you are not meeting this requirement 
in the most efficient way.

I do not make this assumption. What I do is make the assumption that the NSA
has more crypto experience than the private sector. Since Clipper is
voluntary, there is no assumption that the government is doing a "better"
job but rather that the government can do certain "furthering" jobs the
private sector unaided cannot do. Can you say NAFTA or GATT? Can you say
"anti-dumping laws"?  (Let's not get into a discussion of whether one likes
these laws or not--I'm making a point about public economics.)

The "stated agenda" has been widely debated in both Washington and in the
national press, prior to the government making the policy decision that it
should change its policy and provide strong crypto to the private sector. It
stands on widely discussed logic and facts, not some "secret" information.

As I've said in my primary message, the escrow aspects of Clipper stand on
separate issues than does the making available of secure crypto itself.

=======

Some have tried to make a particular argument that attempts to get around
the voluntary nature of Clipper, which on its face makes Clipper
unobjectionable. They have argued two points:

1. The government might change their mind about "voluntary" in the future.

If so, let's cross that bridge when we come to it. Depriving those who want
Clipper with escrow because of some fear of future action is both bad policy
and bad economics. It's bad policy because it can be used to stop any
positive development because someone MIGHT do something bad about it in the
future, and it's bad economics because it doesn't consider the economic
interests of those who want Clipper now, nor make an economic assessment of
the assertion "might make it mandatory in future".

2. Because clipper becomes cheap and ubiquitous, it might drive out what the
speaker asserts to be "good" crypto.

This is essentially an authoritarian, elitist argument. Since the escrow
feature of Clipper has been widely publicized, those who accept it do so
with full knowledge of the escrow. Thus those who argue (2) are in effect
substituting what they want for what those who would otherwise use Clipper
are willing to take. In other words, they are substituting their desires for
the choices of consumers in the marketplace. Actually, "authoritarian and
elitist" are not strong enough characterizations for such behavior, but I'm
trying to argue, not to inflame.

Those who make argument 2 would be among the first to scream loud and long
if an analogous argument were made about something they like--say freedom of
choice with respect to abortion, or the prevention of private gun ownership
(substitute your favorite less controversial topic here--again, I'm trying
to argue by example, not to inflame, and this is not a paragraph intended to
open an abortion or gun control discussion).

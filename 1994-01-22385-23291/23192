It looks like I visit the law library again.  It's hard to keep up with
the revisions to ITAR.

Sfunny.  The more we complain about crypto restrictions, the more this
damned law is adjusted, and not once for the better.  Talk about the

I think your reading is broader than a court would allow.  But who knows,
certainly not me!

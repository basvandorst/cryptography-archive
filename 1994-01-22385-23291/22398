I'm not sure that I would call it a "transmitter".  Any super-heterodyne
receiver uses a local oscillator for tuning.  This oscillator operates in
the RF range, and some of the RF energy inevitably leaks out and is
detectable.  OTOH, this is the same principle that virtually every radio and
TV receiver uses.  The FCC regulates how much leakage and RFI (radio
frequency interference) is acceptable from any such device.  I'm sure that
most radar detectors are no worse than your typical type-accepted receiver.

In other words, this RF leakage might form the basis of DETECTING the
presence of a radar detector, but not a logical basis for banning them.  Nor
have I heard anything that the FCC would be the agency to ban them.  Of
course, if they can ban cellular reception, with the prodding of a
frightened Congress, then .... who knows?

I remember reading that at least one agency in Canada had purchased a number
of "radar detector detectors" to catch people driving in Canada with illegal
radar detectors.

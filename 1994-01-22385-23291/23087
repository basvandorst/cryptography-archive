Here's some info from a brochure I got from Mykotronx.  The brocure also
includes drawings of some of the chip packages.  I'm not sure why since
these are standardized.  I suppose it looks cool.  Also has some simple
block diagrams of the chips.  They aren't very informative, so I won't
attempt to reproduce them here.

Family   A New Breakthrough in Encryption Technology"

Inside:

Clipper Family

Used by both government and industry to protect all types of sensitive
information, the Clipper family of encryption devices incorporates
today's most advanced, secure, commercially available encryption method. 
As members of the Key Escrow Microcircuit family, Clipper microcircuitry
implements the Skipjack algorithm for which the only known attack
requires 2^80, or 1.2x10^24 possible keys.

The Clipper family includes the Mykotronx MYK-78E, MYK-78T, and MYK-77. 
All Clipper family members are exportable in products meeting NIST FIPS
Pub 140.1 and government approval.

MYK-78E

MYK-78E is a general purpose encryption device that uses a Type 2
government algorithm - called "Skipjack" - to encrypt and decrypt data
under a control microprocessor (CP) in the target system.  The MYK-78E
operates in any of the four cryptographic modes defined by FIPS Pub 81.

Package Configurations

-> 68-pin PLCC (Shown).
-> 100-pin TQFP.

Features and Specifications

-> Confidentiality for digital data.
-> Four cryptographic operating modes.
-> 16- or 32-bin 33MHz control and data (or CP) interface.
-> Data I/O buffering via use of external FIFO devices.
-> On-board non-deterministic randomizer and automatic low-power "sleep"
mode.
-> Built-in self-test for enhanced system integrity.
-> Throughput: Greater than 16Mbps.

MYK-78T

MYK-78T is a specialized encryption device that uses a Type 2 government
algorithm - called "Skipjack" -  to encrypt and decrypt digital data. 
The MYK-78T has a microprocessor interface for data control and status,
and operates in the 64-bit OFB mode as defined by FIPS Pub 81.

Package Configurations

-> 28-pin PLCC
-> 44-pin PLCC
-> 100-pin TQFP (shown).

Features and Specifications

-> Confidentiality for digital data.
-> On-board nondeterministic randomizer and automatic low-power "sleep"
mode.
-> 64-bit OFB mode (FIPS Pub 81).
-> Internal oscillator running at 33 MHz maximum.
-> Built-in self-test for enhanced system integrity.
-> I/O of 8-bit data blocks.

MYK-77

MYK-77 is a specialized encryption device that uses a Type 2 government
algorithm - called "Skipjack" - to encrypt and decrypt digital data.  The
MYK-77 operates in 1-bit CFB mode only, and is ideal for digital radios
operating at low data rates (up to 64 Kbps) requiring low power.

Package Configurations

-> 28-pin LCC.
-> 28-pin PLCC (shown).

Features and Specifications

-> Confidentiality for digital data.
-> 1-bit CFB mode (FIPS Pub 81).
-> Supports clock frequencies to 5MHz
-> Serial data interface.
-> Built-in self-test for enhanced system integrity.

Well, that's that.  Interesting what they leave out.  Not a whole lot of
information about the Key Escrow feature.  I also like the way they imply
that everyone is already using Clipper chips.  Whatever...  They also
didn't put their STU-III number on the brochure...

Enjoy.

Oh, I've also got a brochure on the Capstone.  I'll type it in and post
it later.

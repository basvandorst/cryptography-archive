Charley, like I said previously, you should take some time and research
the topic at length. I believe Tim Newsham understands my sentiment when
he belays something along the lines of "Since when did the government care
about our Constitutional rights?"

As far as the Constitution is concerned, its apparently flexible enough
to be translated in any fashion that state governments or the Supreme Court
sees fit.

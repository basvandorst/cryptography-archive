Ah... I apologize for misunderstanding your original posting.  I thought
you were making a *technical* point that the secret key would have to be
turned over for verification.  I didn't realize you were talking about
verifying that a key-pair actually belonged to a real, physical person.
Some of the other postings in this thread address that issue --- but
the fact remains that you only need to verify the public key, not the
private one.  So if you have to register your public key with some
"trusted agent", and have your identity vouched for by a notary or
something, then you should never, ever have to reveal your private key.
The public key is already strongly linked to that particular person.

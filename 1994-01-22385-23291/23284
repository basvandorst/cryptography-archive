   I'd say that the best solution would be write a special backup utility
for this system.   Also, the "salt" should exist in a backed up state,
in a vault in Washington or somewhere.  This allows recovery of the data
if the salt is clobbered accidentally or intentionally.

   You have a definite point, here.  Even if it's widely publicized that
the embassy has such a system in use, there's no assurance that the raiders
won't think it's a lie.  On the other hand, if you were the poor person
who typed in lots of that classified, now-unretrievable data, the bad
guys may decide to extract it all out of you anyway.  I wouldn't expect
this process to be too gentle or particularly pleasant....

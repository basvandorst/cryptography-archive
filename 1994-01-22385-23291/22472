More mindless meanderings.... could you vaguely keep this on topic?

Nobody said trivial or cheap, but one would hope that software
vendors have a configuration requirement of *this* magnitude
firmly in hand.

I mean, if XYZ Software Inc. can't manage to keep a handle on
the non-export requirement, how in the HELL could you trust
them to write a filesystem?  Or respond to the international
market in the first place?

You're skating on thin ice in this discussion -- playing up
your supposed expertise and experience, whilst not making much
sense.

This is Usenet, remember.  People will rate you more by your 
intellectual honesty than they will by your credentials.

Arguing with people like you is indeed silly.

If the person doing the experiencing does not have
a penchant for logical, scientific thought, not much
is gained.

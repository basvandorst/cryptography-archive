Dear reader,

If you or your friends

1. learn Russian language and want to get some Russian books,  journals,
   newspapers, compact cassette and the other materials

2. have  an interest  in Russian  culture and  want to  buy some Russian
   souvenirs, art books such  as Ermitage, Russian Museum,  Tretyakovsky
   Gallery (Russian and English translations), goods, etc.

3. want  to visit  Saint-Petersburg and  need some  help (accommodation,
   guide, translator, etc.)

4. have an interest in fresh commercial information from Russia

5. etc., etc ...

I hope that the following information will be interesting for you.

I  am  ready  to  find  out  and  send  you  above-mentioned  goods   or
information. I think  that my payment  will not be  expensive for you  -
$20-$30  (depends  on  my  time  that  I will spend). Posting expense is
about

$8  - 2Kg package - land mail ( time >= 1month )
$15 - 2Kg package - air mail  ( time <= 2weeks )

Now  several  words  about  myself.  I  am  a  young  (23) Ph.D. student
(nuclear  physicist)  from  Saint-Petersburg,  Russia,  and  I  want  to
continue my  scientific career  at one  of the  USA universities.  So, I
need some money in  order to pay for  my education and accommodation  in
America  and  I  decide  to  open  my  own  small  "business" - "Russian
Express".

I will glad to help you.
Thanks.

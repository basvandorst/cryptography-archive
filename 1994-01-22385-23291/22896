This is one case where Ripem, Techmail, or Apple's AOCE have an advantage,
in that to get an RSA high assurance certificate for one's signature, one
has to present a photo ID and two other forms of ID to a notary. That
creates a rather better chain of evidence, since the notary can be
subpeonaed.

But your comments on the weaknesses in a multiuser system or a poor password
are valid. RSA suggests one treat one's "signer" the way one treats a bank
cash card--keep it on a disk on one's person and give it a "good" password.

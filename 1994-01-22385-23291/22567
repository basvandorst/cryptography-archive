Any magazine can have an off day and a subject the editors don't know
enough about... even Scientific American.  For somebody to whom simple
substitution is mysterious, Vigenere (sp!) is a closed book.  Kahn reports
that the cryppies of the time were not responsible for SA's blunder.

It was being broken as early as the late 16th century, in fact.  The fact
that the South evidently used only three keywords during the war helped
the Union quite a lot. :-)

I should mention that the Qbasic program I described as a Vigenere isn't:
my eyes tend to glaze over when I'm reading BASIC of any sort, and I stopped
reading it before I noticed that he XORs the next byte of key with the
current byte of plaintext after XORing the current byte of key with
the current byte of plaintext, so it's the equivalent of a Vigenere
autokey cipher instead of a straight Viggy.  Thus the attack of choice is
crib-dragging rather than IC followed by alphabet sliding as I was
claiming earlier.  At least I -think- that's what it does...  I'm not very
fluent in BASIC (Gott sei dank!).

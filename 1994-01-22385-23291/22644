ULTRA IN THE PACIFIC
How Breaking Japanese Codes Affected
the Naval Campaign in the Pacific
by John Winton

o Examines in detail the practical application of Ultra intelligence
o Includes information on the Royal Navy in the Pacific
o Highlights the role of Ultra in major campaigns and battles

This fast-moving account of the role played by Ultra in the naval war in
the Pacific relates in a highly readable, chronological format how the
information gathered from breaking Japanese codes affected specific
battles and campaigns.  In particular, the book makes clear the impact
Ultra had on the crucial positioning of the U.S. fleet, as well as
how it was used to create conditions for the success of American
submarines.

Ultra was certainly an invaluable asset to the Allies, yet its application
gave rise to potential detection by the enemy.  This book clearly shows
the precautions taken, while at the same time acknowledging the
advantage gained by the fact that the Japanese presumed Westerners could
not learn their language.  Although the Pacific war has had many
chroniclers, John Winton is the first to focus on exactly what the Allies
learned from using Ultra in the Pacific and how they took advantage of it
in the naval campaign.

To do so he mined the Ultra records declassified by the National Archives
over the past ten years, including official histories, basic message
compendiums, and action decodes.  In addition he unearthed British sources
not readily available to Americans, such as Admiralty operational records
and interviews.  His copious examination of the research results in an
objective assessment of the importance of Ultra in specific actions---
a fascinating story that will appeal to history buffs and the
general reader alike.

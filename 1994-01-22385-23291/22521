This is nonsense. I said the assumption was dangerous IF based on the
addresses. That's non-controversial. Then I gave an example where I had an
academic address to show that you can't always assume something about a
persona just because you know the address. That's non-controversial. It's
also where my message ended.

The original writer then clarified that he hadn't based his statement on the
addresses, though his original message was, at least to me, ambiguous. Fine.
No problem.

You construct an inaccurate syllogism based on the above, apparently in some
desire to erect a tortured connection to an entirely unrelated message.

I don't know what you are talking about here, and frankly, it's irrelevant
to your example message above.

He might have, but he didn't. The language was ambiguous, and I took one
possible case and said "IF". Do you have some trouble with that? Then he
removed the ambiguity in his response. Fine. That's called a clarification.
Do you have some problem with that?

Let's not. I find talking about talking about an uninteresting exercise when
the topic is one of substance.

If you have something to add directly on point in the discussion please do
so concisely without this elaborate second-order clothing.

Thanks;
David

Ok, lets assume that you know that a one-time pad is used only once,
and you realize that the total traffic under this scheme is double.  Also
you need a very good source of random numbers, and you need a
LOT of them.

So apparently you are asking which is stronger

Scheme A:  Send {otp}pk, (message xor otp)
Scheme B:  Send {message}pk

Where {message}pk denotes message encrypted by key pk.

I don't know.  Maybe an expert does?  (If the random number source
for the otp is weak, then scheme A is weaker since it can be broken
without any attempt on the pk encryption).

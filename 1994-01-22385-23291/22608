It sounds like you saw the movie "Sneakers", too.  I still haven't figured
out if it was intended to be serious, or a spoof.  It was at least more
credible than "War Games" with its technological gaffes, like direct-dialing
through an acoustic coupler, or its reference to a fire in a "prophylactic
recycling center".  ROTFL!

BTW, was any of that techno-babble from the good professor (or
the "graffiti" on his blackboard) legitimate, from a mathematical POV?

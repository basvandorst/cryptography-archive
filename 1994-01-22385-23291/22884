	As a novice to cryptology, I was wondering how the Clipper technology
worked.  I checked the FAQ but didn't find any mention of Clipper.

From my understanding, Clipper/... is a hardware device attached to a telephone
or other digital communication equiptment.  Any conversation or message is
then encrypted upon transmission.  How is the message decripted at the receiving
end?  What if the other phone does not have Clipper, can they still communicate?

Obviously, the Clipper encryption and decription functions are private.  How
does the receiving Clipper system get the key to decript the message?  Does the
encripting Clipper actually obtain a public-encription key from the destination
before ciphering the message? 

Like I said, I am just a novice at cryptology.  I hope my questions make sense.
Thanks in advance.

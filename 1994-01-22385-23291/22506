Consipiracy?  When you give someone your backdoor, you have to trust that
they will not give it away to anyone else, nor will anyone else take it
from them.  The US government is a pretty big lunk to be given that kind
of trust.  Too many variables involved to securely trust.

Resources that are not quite so vast, and a membership drawn from
"academics, amateurs, and private orginizations".  I certianly do not
argue that Clipper is trashy.  I'm sure that it is quite secure.  Unless
you are trying to hide something from the government.  Or an entity the
government favours.  Or someone who has acquired the backdoor for themselves.

Clipper digital phones:  Now Joe PI can't tap my phone.  Joe FBI still can.

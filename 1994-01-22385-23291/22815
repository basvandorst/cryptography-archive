Wrong.  Unless changed at the last minute (with Kennedy, Metzenbaum, and
Biden on the Senate side of the conference committee, I doubt it) the
Brady Bill simply allows one to obtain a gun at the sufferance of the
local city administration.  All that need be done is have a policy
of denying ALL applications, and you have a backdoor gun ban.

The Brady Bill merely purports to ALLOW a background check; it does not
REQUIRE one.  It simply requires a WAIT for a purpose shown to have no
relevance in the real world (even if the person is known to allready
own a gun, even if the person has documentable evidence of being eligable
to own a gun, as in a CCW).  Anybody who tells you Brady requires a
background check is blowing smoke up yer backside.  The antis OPPOSED
having that requirement put in...

It is ripe for abuse, and expect that abuse.  There is no provision
for appeal, or even being told the REASON for a denial.  It has language
holding the bureaucrats immune from any liability due to abuse, etc.  The
antis OPPOSED language allowing for appeal or redress...

"...The right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed"

What is it that people have difficulty understanding about the above?
As Martin Luther King once said "...a right delayed is a right denied..."
What is different here?  Or are some rights 'better' than others?

Brady is simply for harassment and providing the hooks for back door
bans by fiat, and harming legitimate gun shows, nothing more.  AFTER
passage, Brady even admitted as much.  She admitted it would not affect
crime, but was but a "first step".  In other words, all that 'reduce
crime' baloney was an ADMITTED lie.  Brady and bunch will spew out more
lies, and the sheep will still believe them, because it is the most
comfortable path for them - so easy to abridge someone else's rights.
The other steps are before Congreess right now:  Ban on this, ban on
that, onerous taxes on this, taxes on that (government goons, and people
with the 'right' privilege status exempted, of course...)  Any firearm
useful for defense or keeping its operator alive in a fight are on the
list.  Metzenbaum is even muttering about so-called "sniper rifles"
(rifles capable of long range accuracy).  After so-called "assault guns"
(any semi-auto with removable magazine or that takes more than X shots),
high capacity pistols and "sniper rifles", what is left?  Muzzle loading
muskets?

Smell the weeds, folks.

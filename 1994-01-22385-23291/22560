How could SA claim in 1917 that Vingere (sp?) was unbreakable?
It was used by the South in the Civil War, and the North routinely broke
it, with disastrous results for the South. It's about as much harder to
break than straight substitution as the key length. IE if you have an
8-letter key, then you need 8 times as much ciphertext to break.

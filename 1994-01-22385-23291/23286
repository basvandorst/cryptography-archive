  One solution for *this* problem might be to have data entry personel rotate
at radom intervals, or to have them enter data that's already been encrypted
and then would be decrypted once the system went online.  Or, you could simply
have a centralized data entry point (say in D.C.) for all the general
classified data and have that either transmitted by satelite or by courier to
the embassy in question (so much for the rotating typist).

There is a difference between appeals to authority and recitation of
relevant experience. If I say "because I was king" that is an appeal to
authority. If I say "when I was king I had the following experience" it is
not.

I have given several here who seem genuinely interested the necessary
information by e-mail. You seem more intent on make-wrong than anything
else, so you are going to have to do a bit of your own work on this. Perhaps
checking Who's Who in Finance and Industry from the '60s and '70s would
assist you. Also Who's Who in the West from the same period. You can even
learn where I used to live and how many kids I have.  :-)

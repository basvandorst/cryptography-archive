   Very true!  In a real commercial application, you probably would want
something like one of these certificates.  For some applications, you'd
want even further proof--perhaps a company that bonded people would be
used to verify their identity, and their ability to pay for any business
they did with their RSA or DSA signature.
 
   PGP certainly doesn't provide such services itself, but an interested
party could do so for PGP signatures.  Perhaps ViaCrypt's implementation
of PGP will lead RSA or some other reputable party to offer this kind of
service.

   Yes.  The security measures needed depend a lot on what you're using
your signatures for.  If you're in the business of verifying peoples'
RSA keys and bonding them, then you will use things like armed guards,
security cameras, and threshhold schemes to ensure that only officially
authorized people get key certificates.  If you use your RSA scheme to
write digital checks, then it's probably sufficient to use a dedicated
smart-card with a good password on it.  If you use it to send e-mail
to your girlfriend, just keeping the disk in your bookbag is probably fine.

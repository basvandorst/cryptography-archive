      Let's say, you are given a product of two primes, N=P*Q and you
wonder (and hope) whether it is a factor of some Carmichael number.
Here is a simple test that should resolve the issue.
     The primes in a Carmichael number are of the form,
     p1=kr1+1
     p2=kr2+1
hence, their product results in a quadratic equation, the root of which,
positive and integral, is the common factor k. Finding such a root is,
obviously, tantamount to factoring of N. Needless to add, not all N's are
so cooperative.
      Here is an example, borrowed from R.G.E.Pinch:

      N=638 270 232 7
      k=14586
      r1=5
      r2=6
      r3=7
and
      P=72931
      Q=87517
      R=102103
The product, U3=P*Q*R=651693055693681 is a Carmichael number.
A practical matter: finding the right combination of r1, r2 is a matter
of running two loops over some range of values and solving the quadratic
equation until an integral solution is found (if any).

PS: I notice that some of the folks, known to run errands for the
government agencies (for a fee, of course), are suddenly getting agitated.
Is their livelihood being threatened?

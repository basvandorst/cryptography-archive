I think it's fair to say that, whether differential cryptanalysis as
an attack mode in the real world is practical or not, making sure your
cryptosystem can resist it is also likely to make it resistant to
related lines of attack, some of which may not even have been thought
of yet.  Briefly put, patch every hole, whether you believe an
adversary can use it or not.  Just my 2 cents' worth, of course...

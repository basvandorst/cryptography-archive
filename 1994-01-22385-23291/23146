   John, making the random numbers available via FTP is an interesting
idea, but there's a couple of things to consider if you want people
to trust your random number source, and to use it. Firstly, you must
never give out the same sequence of random numbers more than once, and
you must not store it on magnetic media -- ever. Secondly, you will
have to put a digital signature on any sequence you send out, otherwise
a spoofer could substitute some known data for the random data. Lastly,
you'll have to encrypt it with a PK system so that the spoofer cannot
just copy the random numbers. Wise use of PGP can ensure a secure and
authenticated transfer of the data.

   A request for random data would have to include the requestors
public key.

   The measures above can ensure trust of the transmission, but not the
source of the data. The use of a properly random stream of data that
interests cryptographers is one time pads -- these are provably secure,
but once you start throwing one-time-pads around the net encrypted with
PGP, the result is no more secure than PGP -- (which is very good, but
not as good as a one time pad). What people need is their own random
number generator. Really paranoid people will want to make their own from
plans. If you can publish plans in your magazine, where someone with
average intelligence and soldering ability can go to radio-shack,
buy the components and make one (one of the components may be a
smoke detector for the radioactive source), that would be pretty cool.
I'd recommend something that plugs into a serial port, and produces a
stream of random numbers at 56 KBaud. Not all PCs can read data from
the parallel port.

   Get PGP -- it comes with source. Buy the Applied Cryptography
book (mentioned earlier in this group -- it's great.

   Lets decide on what to do -- I'd be interested if I think it'll be
useful.

   I'm dying to know what their answer was -- The cynic in me says
that the answer was "I shoot where and when ordered"

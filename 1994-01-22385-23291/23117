Nobody is saying the differential cryptanalysis was used during WWII; in
fact there is no evidence that the technique was even known at the time. 
However, the original posting was concerning the improbability of chosen-
and known-plaintext attacks.  I think it is quite clear that both are
possible, and have been sucessfully used in the past.  As far as getting
enough material, most messages will contain enough data for dozens of
pairs.  With DES, for example, a 'pair' is two 8-byte blocks.  A 32-byte
message has 6 possible pairs, and it grows exponentially from there. 
Just this paragraph I've written would contain over three thousand pairs
if it was encrypted with DES.

679characters *  1 block/8 chars ~ 85 blocks

85 * 84 / 2 = 3570 pairs.

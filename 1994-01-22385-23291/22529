Hello there,

To those that read this message : Happy New Year. I am interested in tracking
down some research papers, technical reports, etc, that address the issue
Security of Mobility in a Distributed Environment. I would appreciate any
input received on this issue and would like to talk to anyone working in
this area of research.

Best regards

Sean B. O'Connell

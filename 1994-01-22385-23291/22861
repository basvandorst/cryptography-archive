** I would agree. However, what I was saying with regard to the original 
   question is that it would be unwise, for the moment at least, for 
   the company in question to move towards an electronic signature 
   method until one or two cases have come before the English courts
   abd they have had the oportunity to formulate policy. 

   It is important to recognise that any legal system is not just based on
   issues of justice, morality and what is right or wrong. To a large 
   extent new areas of law are created with "policy considerations" in 
   mind. The English legal system is very slow to come to grips with 
   new technologies and, I am afraid, it is and always has been very
   sceptical of concepts which require complex interpretation by 
   "experts" rather than by the judiciary itself. The English legal system
   has always relied on scientific advice, however at the end of the day
   judges are reluctant to formulate policy unless they themselves rather
   than experts are setting the criteria.

   All in all, I would imagine that the judiciary would accept the concept
   of electronic signatures. However, I would not be surprised if the 
   first case to pass through the system eventually ends up in the House
   of Lords for a final judicial and policy consideration statement. 
   Only the largest of companies are in a position to afford such expensive
   litigation.

Flailing about madly, _after_ getting caught, is *not* the same as not
doing the deed in the first place.

Yes, it's a Good Thing that the government is held accountable for it's
actions - but better still would be if it's different agencies and
departments didn't do stuff that they'd have to worry about getting
"caught" _at_.

I think we'd all agree that it would be much preferable if the government
were genuinely trustworthy in the first place, rather than  (as is
generally agreed, I would think) so fumble-fingered that it's likely to
get caught after the fact.  If but a single decade were to go by without
some government scandal, I might _think_ about trusting them; until then,
better not to tempt them, I'd say.

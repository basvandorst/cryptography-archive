MD5 is derived from MD4. MD5 has more processing steps
and the algorithm is more complex. The added processing is intended to 
make MD5 more secure. One recent book, incredibly and without 
documenting the assertion, claims that MD4 is stronger. I believe that the 
consensus is that MD5 is stronger.

By the way, the secure hash algorithm (SHA), developed by NIST & NSA, 
and now a FIPS standard, is also based on MD4. SHA produces a 160-bit
hash output and probably is stronger than MD5.

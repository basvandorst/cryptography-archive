In both cases, they need physical access to the secret keyring. He should
be using the same sort of caution used with any valuable. For instance, my
secret keyring resides on a floppy. If that floppy is not on my person or
in the drive, it's in a locked box and the key to that box is on my person.
It should be rather difficult to steal the key under those conditions. 

The normal rules about reasonable precautions apply. For instance, if you
leave signed blank checks laying about, the bank can and will hold you
responsible for them. You can claim they were stolen all you want, and you
will still be responsible since you didn't take reasonable precautions to
prevent this from happening. This applies not only to physical security
on the keyring, but to choice of passphrase as well.

It also applies to how I use it. For instance, I will not give any
computer but my own access to the keyring. If I am to use the key to
authenticate things, it must never ever be allowed to wander out of my
possession. Letting it out would be equivalent to leaving signed blank
checks laying around. This eliminates the possibility of another system
grabbing my key when it accesses it. With electronic documents, it's
easy enough to take a copy of it to my private system, sign it and send
it back. The secret key never leaves a system I control.

Use of the key for simple identification is another matter. IMO such a
key should never be used for authentication. If used on an ID card or
something like you suggest, it would be no better than a presigned
document. In cash handling, I was taught *never* to accept a check or other
financial document that had not been signed in my presence, specifically
to foil such tricks. The same logic applies here: secret keys used for
signatures must not be used for purposes that require making them public.

The secret key cannot be determined knowing only the public key. Unless
they physically obtained your secret keyring, they could not have forged
your secret key. See above.

So where's the key revocation? Again, with reasonable precautions it should
be apparent that *someone* broke the lock and got at the disk. If someone
steals your credit card and you fail to report it stolen, you are responsible
for the charges they make on it. Same deal here. If you have reason to
believe your key has been compromised and you fail to revoke it, you take
responsibility for it's misuse.

No more than claiming that, if a signature matches one on file, the person
who made the signature must be the person who signed the signature card
in the first place. 

Just as with physical signatures, it comes down to a matter of use. With a
signature, you have to insure that J. Random Crook can't easily get original
signatures from you. Most people handle this by not signing blank forms. The
same applies to keys. You use the key in such a way that it's not easy for
someone else to copy it. With a physical signature, if you sign a blank form
and leave it, it's going to be very hard for you to disavow that form when
someone grabs it and fills the rest of the information in. Ditto for your
secret key.

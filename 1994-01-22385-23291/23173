John Kelsey proposed a secure hard-disk system with a "salt" that could
be deleted via a special command or a kill switch, and pointed out that:

	Once the Salt's been destroyed, no amount of coercion
	will retrieve the actual key.

But how would you do backups of the hard disk?  Any backup scheme that
could recover from a head crash could also recover from an intentional
deletion of the salt.

Also, it should be noted that it's only fair for the personnel who work
with a system like this to be fully informed that

(1) the key is utterly, absolutely, and forever gone once the "salt"
    has been destroyed; and

(2) in case of a takeover of the embassy, they will most likely face
    agonizing torture or death at the hands of enemy interrogators who
    will simply refuse to accept claims that the actual key is unknown
    and unknowable -- perhaps because the interrogators themselves will
    have been told their own lives depend on their getting the key.

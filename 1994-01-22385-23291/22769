OK, then, if it is a fact, you should be able to prove it.  It'll be, uh,
tricky to prove that nobody in the history of mankind has ever written a
program or built a device that "cleans the entire disk".

If, however, you had said:

    "Mumble Foo is the only utility we know of that cleans the entire
     SCSI disk on a UNIX system."

or:

    "Mumble Foo is the only DIS-approved utility that cleans the entire
     SCSI disk on a UNIX system."

I wouldn't have said a word.

Sounds fishy to me.  DIS approved it even though it doesn't work?

Yeah, that's more like it.  Less hypeful than your original claim.

     I remember reading somewhere that the paralell port on some
PC's is simply a 74374 style latch and cannot take input.  Most
newer PC's probably have the parallel port integrated into one
of the three or four VLSI chips that make up a whole motherboard
these days, though, and those parallel ports should be 
bi-directional.
     Here's my suggestion:  use the serial port.  You could wire 
up a UART to transmit, say, $FF when an event occcurs, and $00 
when no event occurs.  That way, you could use off-the-shelf 
terminal emulation software to acquire the data (with ASCII
capture).

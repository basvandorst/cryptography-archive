So what? This simply supports my point that a legitimately accepted role for
the government is to "further" the economy. Can you say "Full Employment Act
of 19xx", for example? Can you say "Federal Reserve Act"? Can you say
"Department of Agriculture"? Though you may disagree with particular
policies, there's not doubt about the legitimacy of the government's role
here.

The sub-discussion was on the legitimacy of government's role with respect
to the economy. Thus the examples were on point and your cavil is not.

Wrong? As a factual matter the whole thing is still in discussion, people
have been making representations, some Congresspeople have taken notice.
Thus it's possible to discuss details. Further, the government has even
recently shown that some aspects are still under consideration. Thus it's
perfectly proper to separate the issue of the escrow and assurances it will
work as advertised and not otherwise from the basic issue of NSA providing
secure crypto to the private sector. Further, as a matter of elementary
policy analysis it's inaccurate to make arguments that are really about the
escrow as if they were arguments about other aspects of the proposal, and is
sure to get the arguer ignored as uh, er, um "not fully informed".

I see. So you want to deprive consumers in the marketplace from free choice
because it's "easier" than dealing with any perhaps changes to behavior in
the future. I'd like to introduce you to my friend Filanovsky, formerly
employed at Gosplan in Moscow.

Straw man. The private sector does use RSA, TDES, Ripem, Techmail, TISPEM,
etc. etc.

Right. The old "I know more than you do" argument. We've seen this contempt
before in some characterizations by elitists of general computer users. Feh!

So what? You have to keep books the way the IRS wants you to. You have to
file reports to the Department of Commerce the way they want you to, etc.
etc. This is another straw man argument in the sense that it has nothing
specific to do with Clipper, but rather touches on the government's right to
insist on the form in which you deal with it in business and regulatory
transactions, particularly when privacy or security matters are involved.
You can still write your Congressperson or President unencrypted.

There's no economic basis for this assertion. The government is not selling
crypto systems. You might as well argue it's unfair for the government to
subsidize the invention of, say, microcircuits, because that is an attempt
to grab monopoly control over a market.

What's more, from the private manufacturer's point of view he can use
non-Clipper systems at costs that make little difference to his final price.

As for compatibility, I find this point, if you'll excuse my saying so,
laughable and I'll say why. Right now there are no standards but rather
competing cryptographic systems in the private sector. Though you may not
like clipper for whatever reason, it is an advance toward compatibility
compared to what we have now.

Readers will note that I've dealt with each of Krawitz' points on substance.
If he replies as he has in the past with statements like "full of it" he
will only succeed in further disgracing himself.

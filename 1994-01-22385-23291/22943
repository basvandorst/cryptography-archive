Summary: HELP locating Australian Government conventional block cipher
Lines: 16

In the last couple of months or so I heard somewhere that the Australian
government was proposing to use a conventional block cipher created
by its own people. I am interesting in researching this further, any
help in locating information regarding:

* the full name of the cipher
* where to get the specification of the algorithm

would be much appreciated.

  The current red-tape strangulation of American business makes it clear
that this "process", whatever it is, does not work.

  I don't need to be told to read "Congress" (or "the bureaucrats", or
whatever else is appropriate) when someone claims that a certain action
to increase government control is done in the name of [swelling patriotic
fanfare in the background] "The People".
  If you had intended to argue the merits of the issue instead of trying
to tack bogus legitimacy to the regulations, you would have simply written
"Congress", so that we could read it that way without parenthetical comment.

  And when you live in certain neighborhoods, paying kneecap insurance
is an much a cost of doing business as any other.

  Hence the bias in Big Business in favor of bureaucratic regulation; it
gets rid of the competition more effectively than anything Rockefeller
was ever accused of doing and looks perfectly legitimate on the surface.

It seems to me that if you wanted a random distribution from a nuclear
source, all you would need would be two of them; for a given clock period
you have four states that can exist: pulse from a, pulse from b, pulse
from both, or neither. They would have to be far enough apart the third
possibility wouldn't be enhanced by Compton scattering events from one
detector into the other. You could get pretty close to 50.00...% probability
by toggling the output state depending on which detector produced the 
last pulse.

  Even if this were granted (and there is no reason to do so, given the
extremely limited hard information on the NSA's abilities), the fact that
the NSA has different _interests_ than the private sector makes it irrelevant:
better to entrust yourself to a surgeon whose blade-wielding skills are
mediocre than to a mugger whose blade-wielding skills are excellent.

  Even if this is stipulated, it is insufficient unless and until you
establish that cryptography, specifically, is an example of an area that
can best be furthered by government.

 >Can you say NAFTA or GATT?

  Fine examples of the government removing some of its own bad regulations
on international trade.  It should do the same in the crypto field.

 >Can you say "anti-dumping laws"?

  Can you say, "Bend Over, Consumer"?

 >(Let's not get into a discussion of whether one likes these laws or not --

  Let's not argue about whether or not these examples indicate that government
intervention in general is a good thing or a bad thing; that surely has
nothing to do with the question of whether or not we should have government
intervention in cryptography.

  How, exactly, does this debate over the government's rationales offered
for public consumption demonstrate that there is no hidden agenda?

  The private sector is quite capable of supplying its own, thank you very
much.  Do you still deny that your argument is based on Implicit Assumption #4?

 >It stands on widely discussed logic and facts, not some "secret" information.

  The argument that the government is trying to pull something again also
stands on widely discussed logic and facts; just go back through this
newsgroup.

By being slightly more difficult to break than it is worth.

The programs, at least for the Apple CD-ROM, are stored on a file on
the CD-ROM.  This file is an encrypted image of a regular hard drive,
and a special driver isprovided to mount it.  The encryption for the
directory and the boot sector is trivial-- XOR with $C8.
The actual programs on the disk are protected by a more complicated
scheme with a 64-bit key.  This scheme involves shifts, XORs, additions,
etc, but no table lookup or multiplies, divides, etc.
 Each 64-bit block of data is encrypted
separately, and the key is different for each product.

Once you recognize a known pattern in the encrypted data (there's
usually a block of zeroes easily recognizable), you could probably
reduce the encryption scheme to 64 equations with 64 unknowns, and
figure out the key that way.  I'm not into cryptographic analysis, so
I don't know how hard that would be.  But I don't believe it is
intractable.

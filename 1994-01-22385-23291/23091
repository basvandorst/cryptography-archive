We have such a system for distributing data to other scientists (when
the data is too big to transfer over the net) and archiving some of
out old data.  We buy our disks in quantities of 100, and if I
remember correctly the price for 100 is around $2500.  The photo CD
disks are a bit cheaper, and we considered using them (since they are
the same technology), but were warned (strongly) that they presume
some fault-tolerence in the format, and thus are a bit more
error-prone.  (The same is true in comparing data grade and consumer
grade 8mm and DAT tapes; we used to use consumer grade, but had a
failure rate of almost 75% once the tapes were about 1 to 2 years old,
compared to a very low rate (circa 5%) rate for 2 year old data
grade tapes; also the failures in the data grade tapes were typically
less catostraphic than the consumer grade tapes.)  Finally, it takes
about 1 1/2 to 2 hours to write an entire disk (at least with the
system we have; Panasonic I think).  I would think that doing this
would probably push the disks up around $100 to $200 per disk in
production costs.  We just published a small number of "standard"
CD-ROMs with some of our data, and even for a small run (I think we
made 300 or 400 copies), the cost only came to a few dollars (if that)
per disk, including insert printing and packaging.

[sci.crypt and alt.privacy removed from followups: line; this has
nothing to do with those groups...  In fact, this really doesn't have
all that much to with security]

We do.

It is NOT our intention to protect the UC2 file format, we will place
that in the public domain.

Is IS our intention to protect the technology in the executable. We don't
dirtribute the source, and we don't want people to somehow extract source
from the executable (decompile etc.).

PKUNZIP is NOT free for commercial (re)distribution, ARJ is NOT free for
commercial (re)distribution, PKSFX is NOT free for commercial
(re)distribution, UC2 is NOT free for commercial (re)distrubution. I
see no difference here.

InfoZIP, LHA, GZIP and HPACK are all free products.

Please notice we will release a seperate extraction tool (UE II)
in a few weeks which can be freely (re)distributed for non-commercial
use.

There is much more to a program than the fileformat of the files it
creates.

Agreed.

Hello,

Thanks for taking the time for reading this posting. I am gathering
material written on the subject security of data virtual private networks.
As this is  a relatively new service in Europe but not in America, I am hoping 
that some organisation out there has looked at the problem and written some 
ideas on the subject.For the benefit of those who don't know what a virtual
privatenetwork is:

A data virtual private network is offered by the public telecommunications
organisation to a customer site such that it appears that the customers
transmitted data is carried over a private networks rather than being part of
a shared or public system. As a result a particular customers traffic is 
generally only logically rather than physically separate from that of other 
customers i.e. it shares the same PTO resources of common switching and
transmission media.

A customer can be taken to mean in this context, a group of users or an
organisation that subscribes to their local public telecommunications 
organisation in order to establish a closed user group for their data between
themselves.

These two definitions are loosely described here.

I would appreciate it if anyone can E-mail me about any on-going project
work in this area, papers, technical reports, deliverables available, etc.

Best regards

Sean O'Connell

Howdy.  I know that there may be better places for this request, but we
don't seem to get those groups here.

I'm looking for a copy of PGP for Unix, and, perhaps, some help in getting
it set up (I'm still pretty new to Unix).

Direction to an FTP site that has it and that I could access would be
appreciated.

Sincerely,
Blain

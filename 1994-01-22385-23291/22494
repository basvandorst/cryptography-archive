Actually there were quite a few versions of SAGE before the final one. There
were also at least two major final versions-- one for the Combat Centers and
one for the Direction Centers, with major differences in some elements. But
I wasn't speaking to that issue; rather I was speaking to the contention of
Krawitz that I didn't know anything about this subject and thus had no right
to comment on it while he did. Krawitz (I speculate) wrongly assumed that as
he knew I was an economist, that that was the only professional background I
had.

Oh?  Please be specific.  Restrict your answer to binary releases at least
as large as a complete 4.3BSD port.

The guy with the commercial address evidently knows what he's talking
about, while the lease impolite thing to be said about the guy with the
academic address is that he is mistaken and lacks experience.

No one who has every been alive while within earshot of a major commercial
software release would ever say "a few #ifdefs will fix things right up."
In the real world, you never have "a few #ifdefs".  You have a zillion of
them, all to fix problems in the previous 157 release cycles and 26
platforms.

Of course, for the next release, Mr.  Krawitz will fix things nicely (and
illegibly and hard to maintain) with the right #ifdefs in his source,
including makefiles.  With luck, he'll even manage to train the people
who run the builds to make the domestic version for the domestic CDROMs
and the export version for the export CDROMs, instead of the other way
around.  That does nothing for his current problem, doesn't it?

Mr. Krawitz said nothing about the difficulties in the real world of
shipping a portion of your software with silly the hope that your customers
and distributors 8 or 10 timezones and 2 or 3 languages away will figure
out where to find the bits you omitted and fit them in where they belong.
Even if you have a big operation with an overseas factory that makes the
foreign CDROMs, you don't want your overseas colleagues to fiddle with
your source while trying to restore the bits you removed--at least if you
hope to have a managable number of customer support calls.

Mr. Krawitz said nothing about what it costs in dollars to ask your support
organization to handle calls from people with the fancy domestic version,
the crippled export version, and the practically uncountable export
versions with the extra bits you didn't provide.

Why do you supppose when libcrypt.a was a problem, most workstation vendors
did not provide it even for their domestic customers?  After all, "it
would only have been a matter of making different tapes, one for export
and one domestic."  Ha!

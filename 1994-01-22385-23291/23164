As far as I know, that story was started by MIT's ``bones'' release of
Kerberos -- that was the tack they took, in consultation with MIT's
lawyers.  I don't recall just when that decision was made, but I think it
would have been in the same time frame as you're referring to.

In the July '93 revision of ITAR, there is some support for the notion
as well, or an even stricter interpretation.  Under Category XIII --
Auxiliary Military Equipment, there is the prohibition of (emphasis
added by me):

	   (b) Information Security Systems and equipment,
	cryptographic devices, software, and *components specifically
	designed or modified therefor*, including:
	   (1) *Cryptographic (including key management) systems*,
	 equipment, assemblies, modules, integrated circuits,
	components or *software* with the capability of maintaining
	secrecy or confidentiality of information or information
	systems,

	....

	   (5) *Ancillary equipment* specifically designed or modified
	 for paragraphs (b) (1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) of this category

As I read it, that could bar anything related to encryption.  If
the hook wouldn't exist for some other reason, then an overly-strict
examiner could rule that it was ``ancillary equipment'' specifically
designed for a prohibited purpose.

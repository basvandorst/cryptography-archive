      Does anybody have software that implements modulo m arithmetic

   The GNU Multiple Precision package may have what you need,

A good package.

   or get the PGP encryption software and look at its mp code.

Which is a damn good example of how *not* to write clear, correct,
complete, efficient and portable code.  Remember, though, that nothing
is a complete failure.  It can always serve as an aweful warning.

Ok, I'm being a bit harsh.  The PGP mpilib works, most of the time,
and on a bunch of machines.  It provides some of the routines needed
in a mp package, but only those necessary for implementation of RSA.
I still don't like it though.

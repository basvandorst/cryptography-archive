The link with the public key works only as long as the "signer" doesn't 
dispute the authenticity of the signature.  If there's no dispute, then 
there's never a legal problem.  However, whenever there is a dispute, it 
is only by getting access/testing of the private key that one can prove to
a certainty that the challenged documents MUST have been signed by the 
alleged "signer."

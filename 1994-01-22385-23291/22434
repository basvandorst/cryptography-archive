Many companies, including small underfunded ones, release software which
they only market in the U.S. (nothing to do with crypto). Thus it must be
profitable.

If the incremental European market is then also profitable they will sell
software in Europe as well. In most cases such software must be "localized"
for European languages anyway--hence at least two or more releases.

Thus I conclude that arguments to remove crypto controls so that companies
can produce one version rather than two are essentially specious--that is
that companies are after a little more profit at the expense of what the
government presently thinks to be national security. It isn't that companies
are prevented from doing two releases and making a good profit on both--it's
that they want even more.

Hence greed vs. national security.

I do not argue whether the government is right to claim national security in
this matter or not, since I am not in a position to KNOW, and have heard
logical arguments (mostly involving increased volumes of strongly encrypted
traffic) as to why the government COULD BE making a legitimate argument.

Note that I have left sci.crypt in the header since I am making an economic,
not a political argument.

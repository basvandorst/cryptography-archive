Does anyone have detailed information on how the Clipper Law Enforcement
Field works?  In particular, how often is it sent and what happens if
it is invalid?

a) The LEF has a 23 bit authentication pattern, presumably to indicate the
LEF is valid.  So if one generated and tested 2^23 (4 million) random LEFs, 
one would find a LEF that establishes secure communication but didn't
contain the session key or serial number, right?  Thus, it seems like anyone
could generate an untappable fake LEF with a reasonable amount of effort.

b) The serial number is 25 bits.  How is this assigned?  Is the unit key 80
bits?  If so, and the serial number just happens to be 25 bits of the key,
then a powerful adversary would only have to crack 55 bits by brute force
which is almost exactly the difficulty of DES.

c) It seems like a adversary could design into the Clipper numerous
subliminal paths that would leak, say, 1 unit key bit every time you use
Clipper allowing the adversary to easily decipher your communications.  For
instance, some of the authentication bits could be authentication and some
could be key.  I understand that wiretaps will use a tamperproof module,
so nobody will be able to see these authentication bits, right?

d) Wouldn't even trivial encryption of the Clipper output mess up any police
wiretap?  E.g. putting an inverter at both ends of the (digital) phone line?

My apologies if these issues have already been discussed.

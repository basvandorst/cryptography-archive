Shalom, Ben.

No, I don't consider any government 100% trustworthy. What I said several
times was that since I had nothing to hide from the government, a voluntary
Clipper the government assured me would keep my secrets from foreign
business competitors would be attractive to me, even with escrow. If I were
a French citizen, I'd apply for permission to use secure crypto in France
and GIVE the government my keys if I had to.

Actually we have a version of this now and it's wildly popular. The only
difference is that it's an implant in your car, not you. It's called
Telocator. If your car is stolen, it will call for help and tell them where
your car is. If you need roadside service you push a button and they,
knowing where you are, send a tow truck.  If you are lost, you call them up
on your car phone, and they give you directions, since they know where you
are. If you are a businessman and want to know where one of your cars is,
Presto! If your wife is late getting home and you are worried, Presto!

The only thing is, it's a private company device, not a government device.
Some here would argue that makes it even less trustworthy. Others would
argue it's more trustworthy, since if the company is caught abusing it they
are out of business.

In addition to the first cost of $300 or so, they charge you a monthly fee
somewhere around $20. It's offered as an option at most car dealers now.

L'hitraot.

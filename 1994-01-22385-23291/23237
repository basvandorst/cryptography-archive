Well, if that is true, then I think you should cite a source.  But until
then, or until there is further declassification of historical documents,
the official version seems to be from Kahn in 'Siezing the Enigma':
 
Under the direction of Maksymillian Ciezki, Marian Rejewski began work on
solving the Enigma in October 1932.  By February of 1933, the Poles were
regularly reading Enigma traffic.
 
In 1936, Rejewski, along with his colleagues Jerzy Rozycki and Henryk
Zygalski, developed the predecessor to the bomby, called a cyclometer.  By
1938, the first actual bomby went into operation, in Poland.
 
The British and the Americans, didn't play a significant role in solving
Enigma until after Germany invaded Poland (1939).  And while the solutions
the British and Americans contributed had greater intelligence value than
anything the Poles contributed, it does not change to whom credit should be
given for solving Enigma.

Oh there have been cases of tampering.  I believe one was reported where
a guy used a hypodermic needle to inject small amounts of water into 
certain balls.

There was another software bug reported on risks where players of a certain
state's "pick 3" game could enter tickets for a minute *AFTER* the actual
draw.  They were found out when they got greedy I bet.

Here in Kentucky our lottery is establishing a very unusual record for itself
and I don't doubt that some day the lid will be blown off.  If its going to
happen someplace it will certainly be in Kentucky!

While discovering that the UUCP maps (uucpmap@rutgers.edu) have been
lagging (seems the PA maps haven't been updated in approx 6 months)
it struck me that perhaps the InterNet transport mechanism, being a
well-defined set of routers and pathways, makes it easier for the
NSA to monitor traffic.

Beyond this, the anti-porn brigade will WANT to ensure cleanliness
of the network.

From my point of view, I would suspect that traffic on the InterNet
will not come under "free speech" protections-  because most of it
is not speech!

I expect plenty of monitoring to be performed on traffic over the
internet.  I'm pretty certain that mailed traffic will be of more
interest to the NSA than news postings...

See?  Paranoia can be useful!  (Mine was well-tuned when I was riding
a Motorcycle;  it's kinda dull when my bike strangely transmuted into
a set of kitchen cabinets...)

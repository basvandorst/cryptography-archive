 Actually I have heard this story going around more then once...
and quite frankly is is so much BS...

While working on crypt routines for TMAC and a B1+ kernel(designed both
for TMAC and for export to friendly governments) it was determined by both
company lawyers and representatives for the US government that leaving
crypto hooks didnt violate ITAR as it existed in 1990-1991(this may have
changed) I cant release the company name involved in this unfortunately..
but this is the way it stood in 1990...... if taking them out is
currently
the way it is then can someone point me to the section of ITAR where this
is spelled out... until then it is so much BS by the TLA's involved...

     cheers

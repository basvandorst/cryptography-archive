     You forget something, though. The government is NOTORIOUS for saying
one thing and doing another. They are also notorious for 'sleazing
through' changes in legislation to further their private agenda, then make
a ton of excuses when the public finds out about it. We are talking about
an organization with a track record of deceit, a single-minded
preservation of their own self-interests, and an attitude of being above
reproach and beyond the arm of the law. Being paranoid is a healthy
attitude to take when it comes to Uncle Sam.

     Believe not the words, for they are as worthless as the air used to
utter them. Believe and criticize the actions, for in watching those, one
can often tell the true motivations.

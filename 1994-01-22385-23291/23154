You borrow the Marine Security Guard's Remington 870 shotgun.  Use as
many rounds as needed. Use a sledgehammer too if you wish. Take the
results and place in a 'burning barrel" aka a one-shot incin,
prefueled with {mumble-mumble} to go up nicely when desired.

Also not that a very important consideration is what's called "burn
time" - how long will it take to get rid of everything?  This is
examined regularly.

Now, microfiche? That's a little harder. You dump {mudder} all over it
that eats the emulsion, then dump it in the burning barrel.

note: mutter & mumble represent details that now escape me.

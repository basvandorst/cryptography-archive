Hmm... so are you suggesting that monies are lost because US businesses don't
have strong crypto?  Given that the #1 reason for that is "crypto export
regulations", perhaps you might be willing to acknowlege that they cost
Americans money?

Given that foreign countries already have crypto as good as the "prefered"
cryptos in use in the USA [DES, 3DES, IDEA, RSA keyexchange], the only
effect of the "export" regulations is to make the cryptos less available in
the USA [which is probably just what the government wants].

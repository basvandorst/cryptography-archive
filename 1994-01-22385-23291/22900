Little sign of those over here, but I take your point.

Agreed.  I hope some enterprising and trustworthy organisation will
produce a similar service in other countries.

If one loses or damages their bank cards one can fairly easily get
replacements.  One's private key (or "signer") is much harder to replace,
keeping a 'safe' copy for emergencies is liable to be contradictory with
keeping it entirely secure from theft.

I'm not planning on accepting cryptographically signed contracts anytime

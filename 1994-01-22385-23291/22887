   From my understanding, Clipper/... is a hardware device attached to a telephone
   or other digital communication equiptment.  Any conversation or message is
   then encrypted upon transmission.  How is the message decripted at the receiving
   end?  What if the other phone does not have Clipper, can they still communicate?
Specifically, it's a chip that can do encryption and decryption using
SkipJack, a symmetric-key crypto protocol, and can also do a bunch of
nonsense designed to reveal your key to Government Agents.
So there's a block of data that gets sent at teh beginning that is
used for initialization (so you can't just mask it out) followed by
your data.

   Obviously, the Clipper encryption and decription functions are private.  How
   does the receiving Clipper system get the key to decript the message?  

Clipper doesn't specify how you transmit the keys; there's a specific
sequence of instructions you hand it to load the keys once you have them.
Public-key, or Diffie-Hellman key exchange, are obvious ways to do it.
The Capstone chip is a Clipper follow-on that does include additional
algorithms including the Secure Hash Standard and NIST's Digital
Signature Standard, and probably some other stuff, which handles most
of the key exchange work for you.

I am designing some security into a product that will be sold in Mexico.
I need a crypto algorithm that is exportable, cheap (preferably free)
and will fit easily into a microcontroller. DES would do what I need but
I don't want to have to deal with the export hastle. The security
requirements are not all that stringent - just something to thwart the
garden variety hacker. If you know of something that might do the trick
I would appreciate a posting here. Thanks.

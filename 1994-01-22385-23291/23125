My main problem with clipper is that I have yet to see what stops a 
"man in the middle" attack.  Just build a box containing two clipper chips, one
talks to my phone, one talks to your phone, with plain-text in the middle.
Who needs the key repositories?  This problem is totaly independent of the 
encryption algorithm used and is based on not knowing exactly which clipper
chip you are going to be talking to on the other end of the phone line.

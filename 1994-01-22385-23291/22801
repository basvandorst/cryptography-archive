yes, I hear he has done some key work in tax evasion, black marketeering,
money laundering, and revolutionary agitation against governments.

: He's in the media a lot because he makes an effort to talk to them, 
: and they often know who he is, and other people often refer media to
: him because he's good at talking about this sort of stuff.  

I wonder if he subscribes to the cypherpunk relgion, `Lies are liberating'.
Given all the pathetically naive comments in the media about him, I think
so. He is the founder, actually. Cypherpunks are always whining about the
corrupt media but then they have perfected ways of poisoning it with lies
about their hidden criminal agenda. good thing that honest people are 
finally starting to notice that you guys are all really just
cyberanarchist extremists.

: I wasn't

go for it! that would *really* prove that he is a true leader beyond all
his bland, nonexistent accomplishments you vaguely allude to. (cypherpunks
vaguely allude to *everything* except the truth).

: Just because someone's
: a leader doesn't mean everybody blindily agrees with everything he

pet Cypherwonks list? hee, hee. like Cypherpunks is the pet Hughes list, 
right? actually, I do see a lot of blind defense of T.C.May by the cypherpunk
zombies. There is a particularly eloquent apologist named Bill Stewart, ever
met him? he is also a master of camouflaging talk about criminal activities
under `privacy' and cynicism about the government.

: Besides, there are a lot of anarchists around, as you keep raving about,
: and we're not particularly into blindly following leaders.

that's right, you are all self-made criminals.

::many cypherpunks promote black marketeering, tax evasion, money laundering
::etc. under the guise of `privacy'. B.Stewart is one such person. Please
::indicate whether you are in favor of this. (Note that T.C.May is the leader
::of this radical, extremist, subversive agenda-- just look at his signature!)

: You're misrepresenting my position.  I support free markets and
: private property on personal freedom and non-intiation of force bases,
: and oppose extortion by governments as well as by smaller gangs.  

don't be an idiot. you know you think that by definition, government==extortion,
and it is silly to pretend otherwise after you have posted all your black
filth claiming it. you cyberanarchists aren't even loyal to your own cause.
you are nothing but a club of backstabbers. soon you will stab *yourselves*
in the back.

: Besides, if
: government derives it's just powers from the consent of the governed,
: as some old American politicians have claimed (:-)), 
: then there *are* no such things as black markets, illegal drugs, or tax evasion

that's right!! Criminals Do Not Exist.

: - there are only markets whose participants do not consent to regulation,
: drugs that the Surgeon General says are hazardous to your health, 
: and taxes that the governed do not consent to pay, plus unjust actions
: by governments who forget where their just powers are derived from.  

oh, yes. the government doing something upsetting, like prosecuting you
for breaking a law!! there ought to be a law against that!!

: What I *promote* are getting governments out of markets, stopping
: involuntary taxation, and having the government repect people's
: financial privacy as well as all other aspects of their privacy.

`involuntary taxation'. hee, hee. sort of like, `involuntary laws'.
we should all have a choice of what laws we follow and which ones
we don't. actually, we should do whatever we please, and if that coincides
with laws, then spiffy, but if it doesn't, don't call us a criminal.
`criminal' is a word the government uses to create two classes of people.
it is unfair discrimination. it is a Totalitarian Police State propaganda
term.

: Unlike some of those famous American politicians, I'm not a drug
: smuggling tax evader (John Hancock was, and more recent politicians
: like the Kennedys have followed in his footsteps.)  And the only money
: laundering in their day was getting dirt off your metal coins and
: writing contracts without the Tax Stamps on them.

Yes, the glorious footsteps of breaking the law. Join the Criminal Brotherhood.
Great Accomplishments in History. Pretend that all the founding fathers were
*really* cyberanarchists, like you are. Why, I think I even heard you say
somewhere that God was on your side. It must be true. It has been repeated
so many times in the newsgroups.

: And if putting something in a signature block makes you a leader, the U.S. 
: government might be overthrown tomorrow. :-)  Tim's is a good catalyst, though.

No kidding!! Timmy is a leader because he has the most *way cool* signature
of anyone!! that alone should give people a tremendous respect for his
leadership qualities. he is a great catalyst to rioting. BTW, how much is
he paying you to post your whiny, sniveling, vacuous apologist trash?

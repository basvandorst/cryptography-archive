Differential cryptanalysis is not practacal against DES because DES is
designed to be resistant.  Biham and Shamir published an article
describing differential attacks against some other ciphers, like LOKI and
FEAL.  Some of these were absurdly easy to crack with differential
techniques.  I believe one required as few as 4 chosen pairs to solve for
the key.  Whenever differential cryptanalysis is not practical, it's
because the designers protected against it.

   The above is very misleading.  It is no *illegal* to export cryptos; 
   crypto exports are *regulated*.   Like many other things.

If licenses to export certain kinds of crypto are never granted, it's de
facto illegal to export them.

   Further, even in those cases where regulatory approval for a crypto
   export is not obtained, there is no "crippling of workstation exports", 
   or crippling of any other system-level exports.  One simply exports 
   the system without its crypto, and then integrates a foreign crypto 
   once off-shore.  This is extremely routine.

Have you ever done a software release?  Rules of this nature essentially
require two software releases to be done, which means lots of extra
time, and hence money.  Rule of thumb: software releases are NEVER
routine.  So doing two releases rather than one means doing two
non-routine things rather than one.

To give you a very straightforward example of this, I found a bug in
rarpd (the daemon which tells a diskless workstation what its IP address
is, given the ethernet address).  Amazingly enough, this innocent little
program calls one of the crypt routines, presumably in the case that
somebody's using secure RPC.  So right now this fix can't easily be
distributed.

There is at least one problem with this scheme as it is stated:
nothing prevents a person from using such a camera to shoot a
high quality retouched picture.  The output of the camera still
bears a valid hash value.  You may be able to prove that a picture
is what a camera "saw", but you cannot, with such a scheme, prove
that what the camera saw was reality.  Even timestamping cannot
prevents abuses.  A killer can shoot some partying scenes in which
he or she appeared.  Later, when he is out to kill, he set up a digital
camera to shoot a replay of the partying scene.  Voila, instant
alibi!

     Ha. This is almost comical. 
 
     If you really believe what you just wrote, I'd suggest you take a 
     few months and research the topic at length.

I think you should take your own advice.  In the Bill of Rights,
the fourth amendment states that "The right of the people to be
secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects..."
Because there is no specific prohibition of method and/or tools
with which these can be kept secure, encryption IS protected
by this.

Reading between the lines of a CACM article a while back, and assuming
CAVE is the same as the algorithm discussed....

1. The algorithm is "restricted" to celphone encryption chip manufacturers,
   to "avoid giving potential crackers any useful information."

2. The algorithm is pure unadulterated dog shit.  No, sorry, that's unfair
   to our canine friends.

Seriously, it supposedly has an incredible amount of handwaving over
how a session key is generated from the IDs of the celphone and base unit,
but then it simply XOR's this key into each 112-bit frame.

The fact that any idiot can immediately figure out how to extract the
key given a few seconds of speech (or more precisely, a few *frames*
of silence between words or even syllables), is conveniently overlooked.

In other words, this encryption technique is about as powerful as the
Caesarian cipher.  Remember, the Caesarian cipher was quite effective --
in an era when most people were illiterate anyway.

The reason we are upset is because the only way Clipper will be
effective is if the gov't outlaws all other encryption methods.
Do you think the gov't is stupid enough not to realize this problem?
If it does realize this problem ( and read the past few 'declassification'
messages to find the answer) why is it spending all the money on the
program if they know it won't work? Yes, I have heard of pork barrel but...

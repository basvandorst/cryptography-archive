"DES-encrypted" passwords on Unix systems aren't DES-encrypted
in the usual sense.  The crypt(3) function uses the password
to encrypt a well-known constant (I believe it's just a string
of zeros) repeatedly, I believe 25 times.  The result is
an encrypted version of zero, *not* an encrypted version of
the password per se.  

This function is not algorithmically reversible to the best of my knowledge,
but of course it *is* possible to guess the password given enough
tries.

Source code for implementations of DES is widely available
(see ripem.msu.edu, for example); also, the algorithm is explained 
in many textbooks.

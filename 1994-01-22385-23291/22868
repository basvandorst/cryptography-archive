You are forgetting Judicial Review, David.

Nat didn't word what he said in precise legal terminology, but when
the courts hold a law made by Congress, violates the Constitution, the
law can be struck down.  There are many cases of this happening and
the entire civil rights movement could not have occured as it did without 
this prower of the courts.

BTW:  You are nearing the threshold for being put in my kill file.

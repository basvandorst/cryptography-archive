David Sternlight seems abysmally ignorant of the so-called
"counter-intelligence" activities of the 1960s in which numerous government
agencies engaged in surreptitious (and illegal) domestic surveillance
of anti-war demonstrators, civil rights activists, and others against
whom there was no evidence of illegal activity. This is astonishing
for one who has been a "distinguished lecturer" involved in and 
familiar with governmental operations.

David Sternlight corroborates Popper's dictum: The worse the logic, the
more interesting the premises.

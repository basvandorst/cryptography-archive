I consider undesirable outcomes when I make an important decision.  

In this case, the decision is not being made by me.

In this case, the decision not only affects me, but the entire populace.

The statement after "unless" is not a pipe dream.  It is not a farfetched
wish.  It is a legitimate fear.  Additionaly, it is not of the same class
as your statement.  The outcome of any Clipper finality is not yet known. 
Perhaps a better statement would be "If my grandchild is born with
testicles, it will be male."

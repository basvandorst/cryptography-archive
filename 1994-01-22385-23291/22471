Actually, I can think of a system that would assure, at least to my
satisfaction, would work 'as advertised.'

Make the escrow agents: 
	1) Junior Justice of the Supreme Court
	2) Speaker of the House.

In other words, NO connection to the Administrative Branch at all.

To insure that they have a clear mandate for when a release is valid,
simply require, (no "most of the time"), require a order from a Federal
Appeals Court.

Now, it can be argued that the Justice would have to exclude himself if
the case was appealed to the Court, but I'm not sure.  Escrow would be
a administrative function.

Note, I'm _not_ suggesting this, and thus implying endorsement of the
whole can of worms -- I'm not. But I think is _IS_ possible to make the
escrow pretty damn tight. The fact the proposals to date have avoided
doing so speaks clearly as to the real agenda involved.

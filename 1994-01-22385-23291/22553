This has absolutely nothing to do with the science of cryptology.
Please take it to talk.politics.crypto. All you have to do is copy the
Newsgroups line to a Followup-To line, replacing ``sci.crypt'' with
``talk.politics.crypto''.

Carrying on a political discussion in sci.crypt is an example of
sternlighting. Sternlighting is, by definition, the collection of
symptoms of a disease called sternlightism. Help stamp it out!

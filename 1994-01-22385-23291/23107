comment

  DC requires knowledge of plain text/encrypted text for the same key,
  which isn't going to happen in real life, even if 
  cipher is vulnerable to DC (not parts of plain text, mind you - the whole
  thing).
  I still don't get it.

Better go study your history.  Knowledge of plain text & encrypted
text for the same key WAS USED during WWII in both theaters of the
war.  That's one reason spies are so valuable.

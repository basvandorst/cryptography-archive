Section $121.1 decribes items on the US Munitions List.  These items are export  
controlled.

Section $121.1, Catagory XIII (Auxiliary Military Equipment), paragraph (b)  
says...

(b) Information Security Systems and equipment, cyptographic devices, software,  
and components specifically designed or modified therefore, including:

  (1) Cyptographic (including key management) systems, equipment, assemblies,  
modules, integrated circuits, components or software with the capability of  
maintaining secrecy or confidentiality of information....



The Gov'mnt probably considers software that contains hooks for crypto routines  
a "component" of a cryptographic "system".

(The terms "component" and "system" are define in section $121.8 of the ITAR.)

From paragraph (b) it is clear that cryptographic software "systems" and  
"components" are export controlled, but I can't find a paragraph that covers  
non-cryptographic software "components".

This still doesn't give my much hope, because...

At last year's RSA Data Security Conference there was a representative from the  
NSA who took questions from the audience (believe it or not).  Somebody asked  
the question about hooks for crypto routines.  The NSA person hemmed and hawed  
for a moment and then said it was a grey area, but it was probably not allowed  
(FUD).


One of the impressions I got while listening to the NSA person was that the NSA  
is not so much interested in preventing people exporting crypto software as  
much as they are interested in preventing people from *using* crypto software.   
That is how I think they justify controlling the export of software that  
contains hooks for crypto routines.

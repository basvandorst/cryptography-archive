As an european, I miss the argument that the european customer should be satisfied too!
Writing a new release with language adaption is done for the european customer's satisfaction. Withdrawing encryption from the security of a system is an additional work, which is _not_ done for the customer's satisfaction, on the contrary...

it forces him to find hooks for implementing his own cryptography and security!
And when just about anybody who can write a program, can write his own DES or RSA nowadays, can someone explain, what level of national security of the US is protected, by enforcing DES decryption capabilities to be removed from exported software?
The result of the regulation seems less to be a problem for the US software producer than the emerging of an independent european software industry capable of putting back what was withdrawn at export due to the regulations! No comments about the regulations and how useful they may be for US security, but facts seem to be like I said.

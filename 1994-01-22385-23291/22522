Also, since the actual requirements of releasing the escrow keys is
unclear and unstated, there is no surety that those keys will be
released only where appropriate. Can you imagine the Committee to
Re-Elect the President with escrow keys to the Democratic convention
hotel?

In addition, installing a wiretap originally involved actually
connecting to an individual wire pair, with a detectable and possibly
expensive bit of equipment that had to be maintained and physically
accessed by those involved. As digital telephones develop, a single
central unit could packet sniff the fiber or microwave links, decoding
them undetectably in near perpetuity after the key was released once,
with no additional maintenance. And as we rely on cryptographic
systems to secure our links instead of the more difficult physical
control, this early escrow based system is clearly designed to
preserve accessibility to the Clipper creators, in return for whatever
security it does provide from other crackers.

Put it this way: when you buy a house and change the locks, do you
give the hardware store salesclerks copies of your keys, so they can
give them to the police if they get a warrant? Even if they'll sell
you Medeco locks, which are almost impossible to pick, instead of the
standard Yale locks which are fairly easy?

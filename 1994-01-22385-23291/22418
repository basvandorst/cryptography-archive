Not to mention the fact that as long as those who use non-skipjack encryption,
while it remains legal, may become automatic suspects.   If those who use
other encryption become a small minority, I can even see, "He refused to
use skipjack" introduced as cirmustantial evidence in a court case.

Most of us see the flaw in this sort of "Honest people have nothing to hide"
argument.  But do judges and juries?

What happens when the predominant non-users of skipjack are the mob,
terrorists, religious cults and us, the "privacy freaks."

Won't it be easy to push through congress to ban it?  Or won't we look a lot
more suspect hanging with that crowd of professional criminals and
troublemakers?

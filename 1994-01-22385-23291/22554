The concept of the clipper chip isn't stupid.  The objective is
"dupe the public", not "good encryption".

The problem isn't that higher-ups in government don't think.  They
do.  The trouble is, they start with an evil objective like
"give the general population as few rights as possible".
and come up with solutions to meet that objective.  It's exactly the 
same kind of thinking that lead to research into how to kill Jews 
as efficiently as possible.  Some of the lower-level types came
up with efficient assembly-line-like methods to kill Jews, and few
of them had any questions about whether they ought to kill
Jews.  Those that did question the policy already quit (or
joined the Jews in line).

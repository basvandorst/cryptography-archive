A public key scheme, or even a private-key scheme with well-protected keys,
does reduce the vulnerability of the one-time pad to theft,
which is one of its main weaknesses.  If the Bad Guys steal your computer,
or bribe the guy with the briefcase handcuffed to his arm, or whatever,
it's not enough to let them break your data.

So if you're worried that there may be a theoretical breakthrough
during the lifetime of your data that either weakens your public-key
or secret-key algorithm too much, this should ease your mind.
Also, if you're worried that the Bad Guys may bribe the code clerk at
your embassy into revealing the private key, this means they also have
to steal or copy the one-time pad.

On the other hand, electronic one-time pads are reusable -
one advantage of the traditional paper one-time pad was that you
burned each page after using it, whereas with your 5GB tape of bits,
you generally don't trash each bit after using it, unless you're doing
a very good job of security.

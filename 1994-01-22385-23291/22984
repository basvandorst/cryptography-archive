I also believe there's no trapdoor in DES, but I think it's undeniable that
there -could- have been an effective one without invoking magic.  Recall
that NSA/IBM strengthened it against the differential cryptanalysis
attack.  If instead they had weakened it or left it alone, there would have
been a much stronger attack on it.  When differential cryptanalysis was
discovered independently 15 years later, they would have retained
deniability: "Oh, gee, there's a strong attack on it?  Good thing we
certified it for only 10 years, eh?"

Building in the strength presumably -did- leave traces, and leaving it
weak would have been undetectable: when S-box 4 was discovered to be
highly regularly there was a lot of suspicion.  Only much later did Biham
and Shamir note that the selection of S-boxes was stronger (rather than
weaker) than randomly-chosen S-boxes.  This leads to a strategy that NSA
could have used (but didn't) to get deniable weakening: use an open set of
random numbers that could be verified, like the suggestions for the NewDES
tables proposed in Cryptologia a few years ago... for example, you could
try S-boxes formed from each of the first 50 pages of the Rand "Million
Random Digits" book, and when you find one that gives the desired amount
of security (e.g. solvable with brute force search of 2**20 keys), publish
the algorithm and point to that page of "MRD" as the source.  Voila --
totally open algorithm... much less suspicious than the approach they
actually used of concealing the criteria they used to select the S-boxes.

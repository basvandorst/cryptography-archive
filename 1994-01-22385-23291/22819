David, you are confounding special pleading (cannot afford to comply with
environmental regulations) with limitations of small business.  You make 
light of small business's right to exist.

I believe the law of the land is recognition of the right of small 
business to exist, and to accommodate it where and if possible.  Small 
businesses are exempt from many regulations that affect larger businesses.  

I am not saying that is what the People (read government, which never 
considers _me_ people) always do.  But that is the stated objective.  Or 
am I mistaken?

This maybe really a stupid thing to say, but why would you want to use a 
cordless phone which encrypts the number you dial and your converstaion?
That would only eliminate the people w/ the scanners.  Otherwise, this 
system is equivalent to no encryption at all, since the conversation goes 
un-encrypted through the phone lines, so anyone can still tap the phone 
line and listen.

It's probably not worth the asking price if you are knowledgeable enough
to surf the archive sites and to select among what you find there.

A lot of developers could care less about the internet and just want
a quick and dirty collection of stuff so they can get their project
out the door. Moby Crypto is for them.

Since Austin Code Works is now legally registered under the DTR, being
able to vector crypto source code out this way really helps to get
it widely available.

        Nothing wrong with it; it will work. On the other hand it will
        use a lot of bandwidth for little effect. This protocol is
        only as strong as the public-key system you use, since anyone
        who can break it can get the OTP and then decrypt all your
        messages.

        It is just as effective and uses less bandwidth to
        use a secret key scheme that is at least as strong as the
        public key system, instead of an OTP. Use the public key to
        encrypt a secret session key which is randomly generated for
        each message. That way, anyone who can't break your public
        key, can't break the resulting message either, so the result
        is just as strong as using a public key with OTP.
        
        Cheers,
                Marc

[taken from IEEE Bulletin, Los Angeles Council, January 1994]

The U.S. government, in its continuing campaign to restrict public access
to strong encryption tools, has introduced a "Clipper" chip as a step
in that campaign. On February 2, the Los Angeles chapter of the Social
Implications of Technology Society will hear a talk on this initiative
by security consultant Stephen T. Walker at the Culver City Ramada Hotel.

Walker, founder and president of Trusted Information Systems, Inc. will
explain the Clipper chip and its effect on government export controls
on cryptography. Following the talk, two Los Angeles area attorneys will
offer a legal perspective on cryptography policy.

Walker spent 22 years with DoD, including NSA and DARPA, and was a
Director of Information Systems for an Assistant Secretary of Defense.

  Gee, it's so nice to know that our beloved government always does what it's
supposed to... the whole idea behind having the keys escrowed by two distinct
parties who were more trustworthy than most law enforcement agencies was that
PEOPLE DON'T TRUST MOST LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES.  So here you are suggesting
that they won't have "tapped" the line before they got the wiretap order 'cos
that would be a 'no no'? [and what about e.g. digital cordless phones were an
invasive tap would not be needed?  Or would the courts hold that a person who
used a wireless Clipperphone had no "reasonable expectation of privacy".]  If
everyone trusts the government's executive branch why don't they just send in
their keys?  Obviously the government would never use them for anything shady
for which they weren't authorised, right?

  David, whether or not you are secretly employed by the government [a lot of
people think so, but I don't think it matters] you certainly seem to be a lot
more trusting of them than most other people.  If one were to assume that the
government were worthy of trust, then proposals such as Clipper [but with the
key-insertion mechanisms corrected] would be reasonable.  But historically it
has been considered wise NOT to trust the government; the Constitution of the
United States and the Bill of Rights were written the way they are because of
that.

Hey! Let's not get abusive (assuming you mean me and not Payne)!
Please re-read my posting. Nowhere do I imply that I know anything
about cryptography. However, I do believe that cryptography is
important, and I wanted to find out if the rumour was true. I waved it
at a crypto friend and he didn't say it was obviously bogus so I
posted it. What's wrong with that?

I didn't know that there was a challenge. Anyway, this guy said that
he didn't want any attention (now). I know it's all sus, but I wanted
it checked out.

Ross.

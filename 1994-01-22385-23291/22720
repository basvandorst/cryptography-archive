HELP!

I used to keep my diary on my PC with the text file encrypted with PKZIP v1.1.
The file has also been converted to an .EXE with ZIP2EXE.

I have neglected my diary for awhile now, and forgot the password (I could
kill myself!).  I have this utility that's supposed to help, but it works
with ZIP files only and not EXE files.

Does anyone in netland know how I could crack the file (or at least convert
the EXE file back to ZIP so I can use the utility that I have)?

I've heard that the PKZIP v1.1 encryption is not impossible to crack.

Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.

 [ a whole lot of drivel about how crypto export isn't as hard as it
sounds ]

Folks, please don't believe Steve.

I work on a software product involving cryptography where we have two
versions of our product: one for export, and one for domestic use.

While the "coding" side of managing this is simple (one ifdef,
touching a dozen or so files throughout the system), the management of
this is not.

We had to write a special program to postprocess our shared library to
conform to the letter of the law on export without also clobbering our
ability to debug code using that shared library.  This program will
need to be maintained

Several of our daemons make encryption calls directly and thus can't
be linked against the shared library in the export version, which
increases the size of the product.

There are two versions of software which have to be independantly
tested, both with functional tests and system tests.  Since the
product is a distributed system, "testing" is not a simple matter of
running the program against a small set of sample inputs; rather, it
involves setting up a configuration of between two and fifty machines
with the right version of software, and letting it run for several
*days*.

Having two versions of the software *doubles* our testing cost..  we
spend twice the manpower on testing that we would otherwise.

Our software distribution group was not set up to handle two versions
of the software and had to set things up appropriately to make sure
that the domestic version didn't get sent abroad by mistake.

The demo copy which gets sent to our sales force has to be the export
version, not the domestic version, because *they're* not set up to
have two versions of the demo CD's.

---
It's clear that an intended side effect of the export laws is to
discourage the ready availability of strong cryptography in the U.S.
domestic market.

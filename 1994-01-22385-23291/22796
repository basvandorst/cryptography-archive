I've been wondering for quite some time about what methods intelligence
people use to encipher/conceal data/messages when there is no electronic
equipment available. Indeed, is it possible create a computationaly 
secure encryption 'proceedure' (a) using no more than a pen and paper, and
a large, but memorable key (like an entire poem), or (b) no more than
pen and paper and a very large key/transposition table like a codebook (
though, not being used as a one time pad). Keeping in mind that the messages
are likely to be small, though probably very redundent in nature.

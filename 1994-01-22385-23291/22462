   This is a pretty dangerous assumption if based on the addresses. Krawitz may
   be a junior programmer, for example, while his academic address
   correspondent may be a crypto expert or policy expert.

As it happens, I'm a software engineer and project leader with about 6.5
years of experience and about 2 years before that as a student systems
programmer at MIT (Project Athena), which involved preparing releases,
among other things.  During a previous job assignment I was release
coordinator (and a developer) for a library involving (at the time)
approximately 1000 source files and 400,000 lines of code, involving 8
different versions.  I performed this function for about 4 years, and
during my tenure the product was known for good release quality.  While
that library is not large enough to qualify as a "large" product (it
pales, for example, in comparison to a full operating system), I believe
that I do have sufficient experience with the release process to speak
to it with some authority.

I don't think that my address was what was being referred to, though.

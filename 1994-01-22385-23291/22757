Real world implementations tend to be significantly slower. There are 
a lot of clever tricks for speeding up RSA (exponent recoding, 
montgomery multiplication &c.), but these techniques aren't (easily) 
extended to LUC. This isn't to say that ten years from now, we won't 
have techniques for LUC. 

My belief is that LUC is probably about as strong as RSA. Furthermore 
if the inventors do get a patent on LUC, the patent will expire long 
after the RSA patent (and if not, LUC is probably still covered by 
the patents held by PKP in the U.S. and Canada). The mathematics of 
LUC are very similar to the mathematics of RSA. (You even get to
use the same chinese remainder theorem optimisation when you know
the factors of the modulus).

I implemented it a while ago, and found that a naive implementation 
of LUC is about 50% to 2 times slower than a naive RSA implementation
using a 1024 bit modulus. This was just a personal project to play
around with some public key techniques.

A postscript version of the above paper is available by anon ftp from 
various sites (e.g. ripem.msu.edu:/pub/crypt/docs). 

LUC is pretty, but somehow I doubt that it is going to be really
important to public key cryptography.

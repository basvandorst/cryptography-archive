Yes, but finding an 'optimal' scheme is hard in the a posteriori universe of
language while finding an arbitrary mixing scheme in the a priori world of
crypto functions is easy.

Thus even simple-minded crypto schemes such as XOR with LCGs pass statistical
tests of randomness much better than even the best known compression
schemes on arbitrary texts.

Don't forget, the owner of a private key will generally have no indication
that his private key has been stolen, unlike a check-signing machine which
requires duplication of a physical device.  (A block of steel, I believe).

It's quite possible that someone could have their private key stolen,
their traffic monitored to see if the theft was detected, and then the
key "sat on" for months until an opportune time arises to use the
purloined private key. 

The obvious countermeasure, frequently changing keys, runs into logistical
problems.  Although I guess one solution is to create a "contact" keyset
which is widely known, and maintain different keysets on more critical
business.  But then you run into increased opportunities for fraud by
a third party falsely creating a new keyset.  (How many people would know
to sign their new public key with *both* the old and new private keys?)

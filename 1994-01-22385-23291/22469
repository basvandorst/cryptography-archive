It sounds as if you are saying that UNIX is not very "crypto-intensive",
and so it is therefore easy to make multiple versions of UNIX to 
satisfy both give the domestic market a cryptographically better
version and the export market a version that is either weak or
has holes for the foreign addition of good mechanisms.

If that is an accurate summary, what do you make of the historical fact
that UNIX vendors have generally produced only a single, cryptographically
weaker version for both their foreign and domestic markets?

By the way, Mr. Sommerfeld's problems sound completely familiar to anyone
who has had significant commercial experience.  "Cryptography" is involved
in many places.  If your product wants to validate a username, it
historically uses libcrypt, which was historically, in practice if not by
law, not exportable.

Releasing software is easy, until you have do it in real life.  Then you
stop talking about multiple versions except when absolutely required.

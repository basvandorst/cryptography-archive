A very good question.  When I was doing the original Seneca post, I was
chatting to the DSD rep about the Clipper anti-tampering technology, and asking
if similar was used in the Seneca chips.  His words were "I don't think that
it's appropriate to discuss the construction details".

Damn.

Possibly.  They'd have to be amongst the top contenders.  Of course, they'd
have to get one first, and the DSD is being _very_ careful about the
device's release.

With a normal device, and a bit of money, a chip can be decapped (or
"peeled") and its function determined.  There are well-established companies
which do this, and can produce a full circuit diagram in about six months
for several hundred thousand dollars.  However, recent developments of
technologies like Vialink make this sort of inspection impractical, and the
claim is that it would take several techology breakthroughs to do an
analysis of a chip which was constructed this way.  Of course, there
are other technologies (eg. thermite charges in devices) which aim to
never let you get that far.

I'm highly impressed with the fact that SECURE eliminates the need for
public keys, presumably by coming with its VERY OWN CIA AGENT AND BRIEFCASE
to do key distribution!  :-)

Assuming this wasn't just a humorous posting, remember that people
here are *much* more likely to be impressed if you briefly describe
the algorithm or at *least* the ease-of-use features.
(For instance, if you'd developed a way to make Diffie-Hellman convenient
for use with email, that would be worthwhile.)
Downloading something based on pure hype is silly....

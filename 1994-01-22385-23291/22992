   The 1989 book on Unix security contains a reference to a work at ATT that

   key generation exchange. 

   How credible is this reference? What is the current situation with
   Diffie-Hellman key exchange? RSA still includes it in its package.

As I recally, this paper (LaMachia and someone else) only broke the
Sun SecureRPC.  It did not break Diffie-Hellman in general, but just
this particular discrete-log problem on which the DH exchange was being
made.

No, DH has not been broken (although there are known attacks against
DH, like monkey-in-the-middle).

Hope this helps.

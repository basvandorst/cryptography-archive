Just about all of the people who replied identified the chip as
being made by Western Digital. Yes indeed, it is one of their chips.
I contacted Western Digital thru their local office (as their
published literature office number has been discontinued). I got a
copy of the specs for the chip, dated 1991.

The WD 2001 is a DES encryption chip, working in ECB mode only. The
version that I have works at 2 Mhz clock, with an encryption rate of
about 160kb/sec. It has 2 8-bit ports: a data port for key and
plain/cipher text, and a command/status port. The specs say that the
WD 2001 is considered obsolete, and the WD 20C03 should be used in
compatibility mode (this chip can do chaining, as well as ECB mode).

The -PH identifies the plastic package, 20-02 gives the clock speed as
2Mhz, 8601 I'm presuming to be the manufacture date code. That would
be consistent with the known age of the board the chip is on.
The chip interface is compatible with the 8080A micro, so the 2Mhz
clock makes sense in that context.

Now to write myself some code to see if the thing still works...

My thanks to all who replied...

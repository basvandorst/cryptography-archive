Why no source?  Is there anything special about ViaCrypt that doesn't
exist in PGP (other than perhaps a slick user interface)?  Seems to me
that no source avail for reasonable price == no deal on something this
loaded and with potential for hidden funniness.  At least not for anybody
at all serious about privacy.

Another problem with this state of affairs, it could provide the excuse
for getting nasty about using PGP (which, of course, HAS source...).

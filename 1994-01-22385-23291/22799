     Three examples of field expedient ciphers used by the Soviets have become
     known.  Two of these are described by David Kahn in "Kahn on Codes."
     These were used Colonel Abel and Reino Hayhanen.  They used mnemonics
     and a variable to generate a very long key that was used in a cipher that was
     a combination of substitution and transposition.  
     
     Alexander Foote describes a running-key cipher he used in his book
     "Handbook for Spies."   The Soviets were great fans of the one-time
     pad and pads were recovered from several spies caught in the 50's and
     60's.   As you might expect, key management using OTPs in the field
     was a pain and the Soviets did issue one set of pads twice.  There is
     also the case of Geoffrey Prime who lost his OTP.  The Soviets sent
     someone with a thick Russian accent to his home with a new briefcase
      full of spy gadgets and gave it to his wife.  At least he didn't make
      her sign for it.

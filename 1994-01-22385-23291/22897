They'd also have to "steal" your password for accessing the private key. If
you are careful to use it only on your own single-user system, and transmit
only signed documents over wires or to multi-user systems, this isn't that
easy unless they're sophisticated enough to set up and get away with a
Tempest intercept or some such (hidden mike keystroke monitoring, etc.).

If your password is worth that much to them, it's also probably worth your
using a Tempest machine and taking other precautions.

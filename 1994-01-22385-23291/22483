Because Krawitz seems not to read my messages carefully, I want to emphasize
that my last point in my previous message, with respect to having software
systems experience, was that I was writing Fortran at IBM in the 1950s, not
writing IN Fortran. (Naturally, I was a member of the IBM Fortran Group, and
many others participated in writing it--I don't claim credit for writing it
all.)

Oh yes, and I was at the Rand Corporation writing part of the nationwide
SAGE real-time Air Defense System command and control software in the '50's
before I went to work for IBM--and SAGE was not only something far more
complex, I warrant, than a simple UNIX operating system but also the first
such system (as was Fortran) so we had no models or prior art we could draw
upon even in part to make things easier. Again, I'm not claiming any special
distinction for those achievements, just putting paid to Krawitz' assertion
that I don't know anything about this topic and am not qualified to comment
on it.

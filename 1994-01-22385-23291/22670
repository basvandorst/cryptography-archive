Richard's Code is part of the Moby Crypto source package available from
the Austin Code Works at +1 512 258 0785

It can do single DES in CBC CFB modes as well as triple key, double block
and other variants.  It is quite fast with assembly language for the
inner loop if you happen to work on a Motorola 68xxx processor, else
the C inner loop works just fine. It includes refinements by Karn and
Gillogly et al.

I measured it at 40x (forty) times faster than the DES example
in the Programming Tools in C book from Cambridge Univesity Press.

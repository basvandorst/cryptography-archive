   I don't get it. Is T.C.May a leader or not? if he is not, why is he always
   in the media articles? why do you pay attention to him? why does he have
   a fan club on the list? if so, why do you claim you don't listen to him?
   very confusing around here lately.

He's a leader because he says things that are often worth listening to
and people often agree with, and because he's done some useful organizing.  
He's in the media a lot because he makes an effort to talk to them, 
and they often know who he is, and other people often refer media to
him because he's good at talking about this sort of stuff.  I wasn't
aware that alt.fan.{tim-may or whatever} existed, but it's easy to
create newsgroups, especially on the alt net.  Just because someone's
a leader doesn't mean everybody blindily agrees with everything he
says, as you may be discovering on your pet Cypherwonks list.
Besides, there are a lot of anarchists around, as you keep raving about,
and we're not particularly into blindly following leaders.

   many cypherpunks promote black marketeering, tax evasion, money laundering
   etc. under the guise of `privacy'. B.Stewart is one such person. Please
   indicate whether you are in favor of this. (Note that T.C.May is the leader
   of this radical, extremist, subversive agenda-- just look at his signature!)

You're misrepresenting my position.  I support free markets and
private property on personal freedom and non-intiation of force bases,
and oppose extortion by governments as well as by smaller gangs.  Besides, if
government derives it's just powers from the consent of the governed,
as some old American politicians have claimed (:-)), 
then there *are* no such things as black markets, illegal drugs, or tax evasion
- there are only markets whose participants do not consent to regulation,
drugs that the Surgeon General says are hazardous to your health, 
and taxes that the governed do not consent to pay, plus unjust actions
by governments who forget where their just powers are derived from.  

What I *promote* are getting governments out of markets, stopping
involuntary taxation, and having the government repect people's
financial privacy as well as all other aspects of their privacy.
Unlike some of those famous American politicians, I'm not a drug
smuggling tax evader (John Hancock was, and more recent politicians
like the Kennedys have followed in his footsteps.)  And the only money
laundering in their day was getting dirt off your metal coins and
writing contracts without the Tax Stamps on them.

And if putting something in a signature block makes you a leader, the U.S. 
government might be overthrown tomorrow. :-)  Tim's is a good catalyst, though.

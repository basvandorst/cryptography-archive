Well, even ignoring the question of whether the government should be able
to wiretap at all [e.g. whether anyone should have to escrow keys] there
are two severe problems with Clipper as proposed which would require some
re-engineering to correct:

-1- Under the present design, the party installing the keys into the chips
    needs access to both keys.  Thus, any real protection from the "dual-
    escrow" scheme is lost given the existence of a SPF [single-point-of-
    failure].  Correcting this problem, from what I understand, would require
    considerable redesign efforts.

-2- If a wiretap order is granted, the government would have unchecked
    access to all previous communications with that phone.  I am aware of
    no one who believes that unchecked retroactive wiretapping would be a
    "good" thing [although DS might].

Producing an approach without these serious drawbacks would not be difficult;
whether anyone would trust the escrow agents might remain in doubt, so fixing
these problems may not make Clipper palatable, but the government's failure
to address them does inspire confidence in the proposal.  Here's how one
could fix them:

-1- Include in each Clipperphone(R) _TWO_ Clipper-chips, manufactured by
    different facilities and with their keys escrowed seperately.

-2- For encryption, feed the data into chip1 and feed chip1's cryptotext into
    chip2; for decryption, feed the data into chip2 and feed chip2's decrypted
    data into chip1.

-3- In case of a wiretap order, the escrow agencies would never surrender
    the keys, but merely decrypt data on demand.  Thus, every byte of data to
    be decoded would have to be approved by both escrow houses.

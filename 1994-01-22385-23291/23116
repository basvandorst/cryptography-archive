  Differential cryptoanalysis requires knowledge of several plaintext/
  cyphertext pairs with the same key . Further, it requires the knowledge of
  exact text, since modification of one symbol in the plaintext will result
  in change of the large part of text. Still doesn't look like any of the 
  WW!! situations you refer to.

Sure it does.  Read ``The Code-Breakers''.  Read ``Seizing the Enigma''.

Oh, you want a modern example?  I walk up to my ATM machine, which uses
encryption to protect the PIN and account number.  Of course, I know my PIN
and account number, and those of my associates.  With that information
in hand, I crack the cipher and collect lots more PINs and account numbers.

On a more philosophical note, vulnerability to known- and chosen-plaintext
attacks is often seen as indicative of deeper weaknesses within the cipher.
You don't know how good the other guy is, so you have to design things
to be as strong as you can afford.

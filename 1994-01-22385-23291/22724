I have a question, but am unsure which group this belongs in.

I have been given the task of looking for any information on biometric data
processing and verification. The application is security but is confirmation
of indentity. This can be used with a crypto system to be used as a dual
proged approach where the system requires controll and an operator. Any body
got any ideas where this type of information could be gotten from?????

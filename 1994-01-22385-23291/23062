The usefulness of a one-time pad seems to hinge on whether the sequence
of key bits is really random.  Could someone post a short, not too
technical definition of randomness of a bit string?  In particular, is
this a mathematical property, or just a general measure of whether the
string is "predictable"?  Does it depend on the nature of the cryptanalyst
or only on the string of bits?  (In other words, if the key is based on
an Albanian translation of "Mary had a little lamb" is it random if you
don't know Albanian?)

Could a program test a key for randomness, or is this meaningless?

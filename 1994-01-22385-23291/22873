Oh, really?  Would you say the folks behind Iran-Contra got "caught"?

The other interesting thing about this argument is as follows:

	OTHERS: What about A?

	DS: Not proven "only distrust" (implication -- the government is clean)

	OTHERS: What about B?

	DS: They got caught! (implication -- the (rest of) the government is 
	clean).

So, David: is there no bias towards corruption in government?  Does
power not corrupt?

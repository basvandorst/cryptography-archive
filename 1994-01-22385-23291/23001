   I'm a professional programmer with a computer science degree, and
I'm thinking about going back to school for my Masters in CS.  I'm
interested in emphasizing in cryptology, data security, and related
things--can anyone give me some pointers for finding a school where
I'll be able to learn a lot in this field?  (I'm in the *very* early
stages of planning a return to school, so I've got some time to look
around.)
 
   Any help would be appreciated.

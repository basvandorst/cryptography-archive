Well, I'll be the 1st fool to guess.  How about something like the German
Geheimschreibers?  Two gears per bit, the gears relatively prime to each
other and generating a pseudo-random sequence of makes and breaks.  
Enough pairs for the number of bits needed for katakana transmissions.  
The West used a 5-bit code (Baudot code, the ancestor of ASCII).  What 
was used for katakana?

Probably, Purple was more complicated, like Geheimschreiber was more 
complicated.  But the gears were the basic mechanism.

I recently came across a credit-card sized computer containing circuitry
which provides an access number on a LCD display.  The access number was
approximately 9 digits, and updated every minute.  The user given the card
has been assigned an "access number" which he/she enters as a userid,
followed by the password indicated on the card at that time.  The info off
the card:

Security Dynamics
One Alewife Center
Cambridge, MA 02140

The card is called a "ACM - Access Control Module" which uses "ACE - Access
Control Encryption".  

Does anyone in netland have any idea how this device works.  I hypothesize
that the "user id" is a seed number for a random number generation
algorithim that is obviously time-dependant.  By taking the userid and the
password together, the system being accessed can ascertain 

1.  The identity of the user (e.g. time-encrypted userid matches password)
2.  The time (+/- a minute) that access occured.

I wonder what type of encryption algorithim they use to generate their
passwords.  BTW, all observed passwords have been numeric, with no alpha
characters seen.

If anyone is familiar with this type of setup, I would appreciate an
insight into the inner workings, etc.

Thanks,

-doug

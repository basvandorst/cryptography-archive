   Unless I'm misreading you, it sounds a lot like a known plaintext attack.

Yes, it does sound a lot like one.  However, I don't think it *is*
one.

What I am getting at is that several different keys may give the same
cipher text from one plain text, or that one key might produce the
same cipher text from several different plain texts.  It is the former
in which we are presently interested.  In either case, one "loses"
cipher texts.  Lose enough of them, and you won't have enough cipher
texts to span the complete set.

No. The government has no authorization to tap a line or record calls before
a wiretap authorization is granted. Thus, assuming the system works as
designed (I agree this is the tricky bit), they'd not have the previous
communications to play with. What's more, once the authorization expires,
the black box with the key in it destroys the key, so future calls are also
safe.

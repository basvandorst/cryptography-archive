It seems to me you are going about this all wrong, you are never going to
achieve decent in-roads on the non-dos market or decent user-respect unless
you publish the source. What you need to do is get yourself a patent. That way
you protect your information from comercial misuse, while been able to fully
distribute all sources. Even if you could only obtain an RSA like patent that
was only valid in the USA and some other western countries, if your 
product is as good as you state, then I'd imagine you would achieve great
success. As it stands, all someone has to do is disassemble your code,
work out the theory behind your compression, and write their own program, or
burn their own ASIC, etc, and there is not a thing you can do about it.

Get your patent application in before its too late.

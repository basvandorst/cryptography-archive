I was paging through some back issues of Dr. Dobb's and noticed an
article on LuC Public Key Encryption... the article claimed that the
method was more secure against tampering (at least with digital
signatures) than RSA...

...I don't recall seeing much discussion about it.  Does anybody have
any info or references on it?

This is a pretty dangerous assumption if based on the addresses. Krawitz may
be a junior programmer, for example, while his academic address
correspondent may be a crypto expert or policy expert.

When I was Chief Economist of a major energy company I used an innocuous
academic address for internet access, which I paid for and was available to
me for energy policy discussions, though my affiliations were well known.

If some junior geologist posted from an oil company address that wouldn't
necessarily mean he knew more than I did about oil industry economics.

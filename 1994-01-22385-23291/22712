One way is to hide the string as integers.
This is not a solution, just a hint.

Write a aux program to process the key part way.
Then have the aux program output this as a text declearation of an array.
Last import the text into the source code.
Then using this array, the real program finishes processing the key before 
encoding.

The process of having a program to write the source code is nice,  
especially for non lineral conversion tables.  But try to keep a copy of 
the program or at least the alogrithim so you know what you did.

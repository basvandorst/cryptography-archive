I think this whole notion that the NSA is spreading Fear, Uncertainty, and
Doubt is just plain silly. Far more likely is that the speaker just didn't
know for sure himself, or possibly the NSA didn't know for sure. That's what
"gray area" means. Then he gave you his best guess: "probably not allowed".

Why do people have to see a conspiracy in everything connected to people or
groups they don't like?

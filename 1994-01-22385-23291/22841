A source with deep ties to the public key community says that Gus
Simmons, heavily involved in the creation of PALs while at Sandia
until recently, told him that the mid-70s announcement of public key
hit them like a ton of bricks, as something completely unexpected.

Admiral Bobby Inman's coy comments to the contrary (cf. Whit Diffie's
article on the history of modern crypto in the book "Contemporary
Cryptology," edited by the same Gus Simmons), I've seen no credible
evidence that the Agency had already discovered p-k theory. 

(They certainly had some high-power mathematicians, like Elwyn
Berlekamp, Andrew Gleason, and many others, but this by itself says
nothing about whether something very similar to what Diffie, Hellman,
and Merkle discovered.)

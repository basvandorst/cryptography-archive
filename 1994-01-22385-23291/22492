How about (as a postulate--I don't KNOW this but it seems both logical and
likely): The government can break publicly used non-Clipper crypto and knows
our economic adversaries can, too. Thus it designed Clipper to be
unbreakable (at the current state of the art), and put the escrow in to
prevent the bad guys from getting an unbreakable system.

It's interesting that those who try to make a syllogistic case against
Clipper always omit the most obvious (above) syllogism, which also has the
virtues both of simplicity and of not requiring dark conspiracy theories and
evil intent.

It's also interesting to me that many here glibly accept that amateurs, a
few academics, and a few private organizations with limited experience can
develop algorithmic systems that the NSA with its vast resources and years
of experience cannot break, but that somehow the NSA is stupid with respect
to Clipper, on which they spent years of some of the best professionals in
the business with full time to devote and compartively unlimited resources.

Thought it's possible that which others glibly accept is, in fact, true,
frankly the odds are very much against it.

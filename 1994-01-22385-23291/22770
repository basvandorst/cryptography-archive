When I was a kid, I enjoyed reading books on codes.  Subjects included:
substitution codes (where numbers, letters, rhunes, strange symbols etc.
substitute for letters of the alphabet), and transposition codes (where
the characters are scrambled in some interesting manner).  I recall
writing beautiful-looking Tolkein rhunes, Free Mason codes from 1815,
wrapping strips of papers around cylinders and reading the text
laterally to force a scrambling of letters, etc.
 
My question is:  do any of these visually and intellectually interesting
exercises I recall from childhood have any relevance today
(educationally, practically...) in a world with sophisticated public key
encryption systems, RSA crytopsystems, modulo arithmetic and linear
congruential generators?  If they have no practical relevance, do they
have other relevance, for example, perhaps children should learn about
them?

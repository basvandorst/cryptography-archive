I just received the following letter from David Slowinski, in which he
announces the discovery of a new Mersenne prime.

Subject: Re: large prime
Status: R

2**859433-1 is prime.

Paul Gage and I found it while testing system
software on a C90 at the Cray Research central
computing facility.  The Lucas-Lehmer test ran
in 25,924 cpu seconds.  I still do the "old" non-elastic
transform multiply.  

Richard Crandall has independently verified this exponent.

Best regards,

slow

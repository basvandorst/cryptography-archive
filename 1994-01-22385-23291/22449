Krawitz seems to be bent on turning a substantive discussion into a flame
war by use of phrases like "full of it." No sale.

On the substance, Krawitz now seems to have backtracked from his original
claim about the complexity of two releases to accomodate national crypto
export restrictions to hiding his argument behind the complexity of an
operating system.

First, this is a special subtopic. Second, with good modular operating
system design, waving the number of lines of code in the total operating
system in the air is a red herring.

There is no doubt that the two-release argument can't be sustained in the
way originally tried with respect to encryption packages, or even mail
packages (ask the Techmail folks). My last message speaks to that.

As to his current argument with respect to operating systems, I think it
also to be flawed, but even if he's accurate, he's not made the general case
he seemed to be originally attempting.

Can you say "lateral arabesque"?

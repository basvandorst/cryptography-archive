  Many people thought the original message was from some bible-thumping
whacko who normally stands on a street corner shouting "The end is near!"

	Well, I have it from reliable sources that what many of us took to
be rambling religious rot is really a desperate, CODED MESSAGE from a
secret agent to his/her handlers.  The spy forgot which newsgroup he was
supposed to post some other innocous message on, to be read & decoded by
his/her handlers, so the spy resorted to broadcasting an emergency message
out on almost all newsgroups!

	It's just a wilderness of mirrors out here, folks!

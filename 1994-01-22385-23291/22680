OK, I guess I get flamed.  To me, this is quite interesting.  I don't think
we want to change the Rules of Evidence to suit computer usages.  Rather,
we should want to make computer usages acceptable to court standards of
evidence.

My understanding is that computer "evidence" would fall under "business 
records" exception to hearsay.  (For our non-legal friends, hearsay is
usually not acceptable as evidence for reasons fans of sci.skeptic can
well imagine.  Business records are hearsay, but if they meet certain
standards of accuracy and impartiality they are an exception to the
hearsay rule, and are evidence.  Sorry for the digression).  I don't think
there is any problem with computer records per se as evidence.  What you
are telling me is that we have not done a satisfactory job in ensuring
that these records meet court standards for evidence.

In my experience as a development programmer for a major software developer, 
I have seen only a little concern for legal needs in software 
design at higher corporate levels, and NONE at the lower levels of 
management where the coding gets done.  

We've got to do better folks.

Well that's how "The Ultra Secret" (written by the British officer who
gave out the Ultra intercepts to the other brass) told the story.
"The Ultra Secret" of course was the first real publication of
anything about the Ultra story.  Later publications revealed more
about the work done by the Poles, who designed the Bombe and with
very scant resources solved other problems that had defeated the 
British up to then.  See:

The Codebreakers, by David Kahn
The American Magic, by ??? (my copy is not handy)
Interview with Marian Rejewski, and related articles
	in the Deavours and Kruh collection (Rejewski was
	one of the Polish mathemeticians who designed the Bombe etc.)
Alan Turing, The Engima, by Andrew Hodges

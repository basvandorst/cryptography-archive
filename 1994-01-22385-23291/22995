	I believe the cipher being discussed here is "Seneca", developed
by the DSTO (Defence Science and Technology Organisation) Crypto Maths
Research unit, and the DSD (Defence Signals Directorate - our equiv of NSA).
There was a discussion of the publically known facts on Seneca in this group
a couple of months ago, following a report of it in PC Week.

>>* where to get the specification of the algorithm

	Peels of Hysterical Laughter - come on, get real! It has quite
catagorically been stated that the specifications WILL NOT be released for
this cipher - it is to be made available in hardware only, and only to
approved government agencies and applications, here in Australia (& possibly
NZ).

LOKI is still round, though its not the cipher being queried. The references
to LOKI have been given in a previous article, although I'm happy to answer
any further queries.

   LUC was patented, but I don't think the patent is valid.    There are
   papers describing this scheme publiched in 1981.  I list seven different
   references in my book (Applied Cryptography, page 318) that are older than
   the LUC papers.

If LUC is not patented in the US, and can do the same jobs as RSA, it
has the advantage that it's only covered by the various patents on
generic public-key such as Merkle-Hellman which expire in 1997,
rather than the RSA patent which expires in ~2000.

Thanks for the explanation.  Obvious now that you point it out to 
me.

I don't mind buying a book, I just don't want to have to buy a 
library :-)  I'll grab the FAQ next time it passes through.

It turns out that Poisson is a very sensitive test of detector system
malfunction.  It is sensitive enough to catch a detector whose 
dead time is creeping up. Dead time is that interval after an event
is recorded when the instrument is insensitive.  For a Geiger tube,
it is the interval needed to quench the discharge.  Taken to the limit,
the countrate would be the reciprocal of the dead period because the
detector would spend essentially all its time dead.  The test will
also detect noisy amplifiers which increase the randomness and will
catch even a little bit of 60 hz intereference.  I even had it
detect a detector which would oscillate and generate either 2 or
three pulses for each event.  From an instrument point of view
I would feel very comfortable with a detector system if the poisson
distribution of the countrate remains stable for a given countrate.

Hmm, between us, we'll figure this out.  

Thanks
John

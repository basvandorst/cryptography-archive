Other problems with UltraCompressor II:

* Nasty software license tries to restrict cloning, disassembly or
  reverse-engineering.  Naughty, naughty.

* Nasty license stops you from distributing UC2-compressed files with
  a copy of UC2, unless you have permission from AIP-NL.

* File formats aren't documented, as far as I can see.

* The crypto bits of the program *claim* to use triple-DES, but how do
  we know they do?  (See above)

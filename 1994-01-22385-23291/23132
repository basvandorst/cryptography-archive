Differential cryptanalysis will probably never be used in practical
attacks on encrypted data. Its purpose is generally to help determine
a theoretical lower bound on the security of a cipher.

Ciphers with 56+ key bits are so tough to break, a theoretical
measure of strength is usually the best you can hope for.

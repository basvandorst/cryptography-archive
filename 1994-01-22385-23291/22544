Oh puleeze... we all know the reason for our benevolent big government
to want to hold all the keys.  It has nothing to do with technology.
It's just another good step towards the goal of keeping everyone
firmly in line.

The only reason NSA has a current lead in encryption is because they were
working on it in a near vacuum in the past.  That's no longer the case
and anyone who believes that nobody else will ever discover anything
of value in encryption is plain dreaming.

As for the "vast resources" of NSA - we all know how efficient government
bureaucracies are.  Tens of billions of dollars are spent by the DEA,
and by God we have a drug-free America, don't we?

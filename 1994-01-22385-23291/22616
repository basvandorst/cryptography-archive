Much as I dislike following up my own articles, I finished the solution to
that Qbasic autokey challenge thing: the 13-byte key is TNT*@sbwMCH1x and
the plaintext starts:

	{NN#@*}[[]]

followed by a CR, LF, and then into the Windows SETUP.TXT file that I
identified in my previous message:

>	SETUP.TXT

Since after finding the SETUP.TXT stuff I was close to the beginning of
the file, it made sense to brute-force it a byte at a time, trying each
possible character and verifying that the rest of the plaintext kept
coming out right.  In each case there was only one character that would
keep the plaintext correct.  Key recovery was sort of involved because of
the strange way the key gets munged between rounds... but what the heck --
anything short of rubber hose cryptanalysis is fair game, I guess.

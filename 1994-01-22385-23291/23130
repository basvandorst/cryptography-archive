   The primary problem with use a more gutsy encryption method is that this
   needs to be exportable, and we had a desire to be able to export the
   mastering system so overseas affiliates could create their own disks.  It
   doesn't make any difference anyway; as long as the cost of breaking the key
   is more expensive than the cost of attaining the software in some other way

Even wimpy encryption software needs licenses, though perhaps you got one.
Technically, they could contend that ROT13 code does too, though I
don't think they really care about that one.

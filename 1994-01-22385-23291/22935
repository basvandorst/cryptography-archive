All you have to do is get the US Gov't to change the export laws.  Start by
getting your Congress Person to support Cantwell's bill, HR 3627.

Other than that, you're out of luck.  The gov't specifically prevents you
from doing what you said you want to do.

Alternative, leave the encryption out for the customer to add from a free
source or become a citizen of some other country where there aren't such
stupid laws.

(Who me?  Opinionated?)

The 1989 book on Unix security contains a reference to a work at ATT that
resolved the discreet algorithm problem that forms the basis of Diffie-Hellman
key generation exchange. 

How credible is this reference? What is the current situation with
Diffie-Hellman key exchange? RSA still includes it in its package.

Thank you.

Michael.

I recall you saying on the Cypherpunks that you were in favor of abandoning
PGP in favor of RSAREF (Bidzos, RSADSI). Given that you are the founder
of cypherpunks, and profiled in all the important articles (wired, NYT) etc.
I thought you might like to comment on this further. I found it
surprising. Would you care to elaborate for the curious how the 
cypherpunks are opposed to Zimmermann's PGP? Or involved in its development?
many people have the mistaken impressionj, apparently, that some cypherpunks
have contributed to PGP. If the leader says `abandon it', this seems to be
inconsistent or a contradiction.

maybe you could repost that letter to the cypherpunks where you suggested
`we' abandon it.

The "classical" ciphers don't have much significance for national-level
encryption or other serious applications, but the techniques one learns to
break them are very applicable to many commercial encryption packages --
especially add-ons to otherwise sophisticated programs.  An article in
Cryptologia within the last few years detailed attacks on a number of the
bogus encryption options of various popular packages, beyond the
well-publicized Word Perfect porosity.  This level of cryptanalysis is
evidently commercially viable, since at least one company makes a business
out of providing cracking programs for these packages.

Most "new" systems amateurs invent can be broken by the classical cryppie
techniques... and most crypto add-ons in commercial packages are invented
by amateurs.  (This is an "ad rectum" observation supported only by gut
feeling, so don't quote me on it.)  It might be an interesting exercise
to go back through the net.crypt and sci.crypt archives to see how many
unbreakable ciphers have been posted to these groups, and how many
survived attacks.

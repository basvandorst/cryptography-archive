I also believe that the proper constitutional defense of private crypto
is the Fourth.  However, the poor Fourth is in tatters, having been
interpreted almost out of existance by the Court in support of reasons
of state.  I nominate it as the most disregarded of all amendments.

I've read someplace that for years the Court allowed the police to 
freely wiretap because phone and telegraphy were not "paper", as if
to say only parchment written upon with a quill pen were protected.
The Court did finally recognize phone and telegrams as protected, but
it took years, or so I read.

Anyhow, I thought political discussions should be removed to 
talk.politics.crypto.  Shouldn't they?

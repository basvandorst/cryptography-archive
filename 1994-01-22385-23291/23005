I am looking for a des implementation for the pc in source form.
The requirements are:
1: must compile on a pc using a pc c compiler such as msc or turbo c
(i.e i'd prefer to avoid porting)
2: must work on an ibm At compat (i.e sizeof(int) != 4)
3: must support ecb (electronic codebook mode)
It doesn't have to be especially fast or support any other modes (such as CBC)
it would be an asset if the code was fairly small (fit in the small memory
model, say). I have allready looked at various kits (such as ufc, pfdes) 
but would like to hear from anyone with pcdes expierience first before 
dooing any work.
Thanks for any info in advance, 

	Rory Chisholm

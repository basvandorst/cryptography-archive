   Why no source?  Is there anything special about ViaCrypt that doesn't

   that no source avail for reasonable price == no deal on something this
   loaded and with potential for hidden funniness.  At least not for anybody
   at all serious about privacy.

What's special about ViaCrypt is that it uses a *licensed*
implementation of RSA (and also IDEA), so it's legally ok to use in
the US, without having to worry about patent violations, software
police kicking down your doors, etc.  If I've interpreted Phil's
comments correctly, the reason you don't get source has to do with
RSA's terms in their patent license contract that ViaCrypt agreed to,
though it may be they could provide source to the non-RSA parts?

Except for the RSA code itself, which the ViaCrypt folks wrote
(perhaps based on material from RSA?), the source is standard PGP.
Unless they've also tricked Phil or something, a la Ken Thompson's
compiler games.

Do I like not getting source with it?  No way.  Is that stopping me
from shelling out $100 to achieve legality?  No.  My copy hasn't
arrived yet; I hope they *do* at least provide a fancy user manual or
something.

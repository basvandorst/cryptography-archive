: I am looking for a des implementation for the pc in source form.

Try libdes by Eric Young (Oct 93) (I think its also called V3.00 which
seems to be the same as V3.01)

Located at
==========
liasun3.epfl.ch
/pub/security/libdes-3.00.tar.gz

sunb.ocs.mq.edu.au
/Unix/Crypt/libdes-3.01.tar.gz

or on usenet archives such as
ftp.uu.net
/usenet/comp.sources.misc/volume40/libdes/part*


I think these are all the same.

This version of DES is written in Austraila and has the advantage of
being stupid US Export Law free. (standard GNU license I think)


: The requirements are:
: 1: must compile on a pc using a pc c compiler such as msc or turbo c
: (i.e i'd prefer to avoid porting)

Worked for me on Borland C++ 3.1

: 2: must work on an ibm At compat (i.e sizeof(int) != 4)

The sizeof(int) depends on the compiler (16bit for BC3.1)

: 3: must support ecb (electronic codebook mode)

ECB, CBC, and triple des

: It doesn't have to be especially fast or support any other modes (such as CBC)
: it would be an asset if the code was fairly small (fit in the small memory
: model, say). I have allready looked at various kits (such as ufc, pfdes) 
: but would like to hear from anyone with pcdes expierience first before 
: dooing any work.

Fits in small. Supose to be very fast (the old version on ripem.msu.edu
says its very fast.)

My BC3.1 project files (although all you need to do is #define MSDOS) can
be mailed on request. These were optimized for a 386 & 387 combination
for speed.

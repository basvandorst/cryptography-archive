Please forgive me if this is a FAQ or is too naive.

In order to attack an encrypted text, do you have to make
an assumption about the encryption method?

For instance, to attack RSA encrypted text, do you have
to assume that RSA was, in fact, used?

The reason I ask is that it would seem that the attacker
would not necessarilly know the encryption scheme(s). 

Secondly, is text that has been multiply, sequentially encrypted
more secure? I.e.

plain text -> simple "JUMBLE" substitution -> DES -> RSA ->
home grown cipher -> etc. -> etc. -> etc. -> transmit.

From my naive point of view, it would seem that attack
would get progressively harder since you don't know 
which types of encryption have been used or how many of them,
let alone the order they were applied.

To illustrate my question, let's say you successfully attack an RSA 
encrypted message and the result looks like garbage (I'm not sure
this is possible since I don't know the stopping criteria for the attack)?  
Then what?

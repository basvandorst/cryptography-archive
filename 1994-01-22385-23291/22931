   It seems to me you are going about this all wrong, you are never going to
   achieve decent in-roads on the non-dos market or decent user-respect unless
   you publish the source. What you need to do is get yourself a patent. That way
   you protect your information from comercial misuse, while been able to fully
   distribute all sources. Even if you could only obtain an RSA like patent that
   was only valid in the USA and some other western countries, if your 
   product is as good as you state, then I'd imagine you would achieve great
   success. As it stands, all someone has to do is disassemble your code,
   work out the theory behind your compression, and write their own program, or
   burn their own ASIC, etc, and there is not a thing you can do about it.

   Get your patent application in before its too late.


It is already too late in most of the world.  The prior disclosure
rules will prevent a patent being granted.  You might get US
protection, but I'm not a US lawyer.

   Hmmm.  It seems to me that the problem isn't with relying upon digital
signatures, but with a) relying on poorly designed systems, and b) appeals
to the old "if the computer says it happened, it must have happened" bit.
I believe an ATM network system *could* be designed that would be much less
susceptible to fraud and error than current systems.  Surely this would be
better than what's there now!  However, we need to get one idea straight in
*everyone's* head:  There's a trade-off between security and usability.
ATM cards will *always* be stealable, because the measures needed to make
them impossible to steal would be far too expensive, intrusive, and in-
convenient.  And errors are almost certain to remain in any redesigned
system, as they exist in *all* complicated computer systems.
 
   Currently, someone can steal my checkbook, write a $10,000 check on it,
and give me lots of grief.  Cryptographic technology can make that sort
of scam *much* harder, but I can't see a practical way to make it impossible.
"Unbreakable" systems are for nuclear missile launch codes.  "Very hard
and expensive to break" systems are more practical, since they *don't*
require hundreds of millions of dollars per year to operate.
 
   It seems like what we need in US/UK law is a few major precedents, so
that judges know how to deal with electronic evidence.  If someone steals
my checkbook, and writes a $10,000 check on it, I may have some rough
times ahead of me, but I will probably eventually be able to convince
the authorities that I didn't do it.  At the same time, if I *do* write
a $10,000 check, and then try to refuse to honor it, I'm likely to have
a pretty hard time convincing the authorities not to hold me to it.
Similar legal procedures will have to evolve for electronic schemes.

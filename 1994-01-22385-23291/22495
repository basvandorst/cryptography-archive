Thanks to all who responded to my query (and double thanks for not
flaming me for asking such a stupid question :-).

}The feds have tried to outlaw non-approved encryption before, but
}that is not the root of the problem with the Clipper chip. Those are
}two-fold:
}
}1. Only "a team of approved experts" will be *permitted* to examine
}the encryption algorithm. Modern ciphers rely on public review to
}look for holes and weaknesses, so the possibility of an unknown
}weakness exists, or even a subtle back door providing access to the
}NSA, who many suspect was instrumental in the development of this
}chip.
}
}2. The chip requires 2 keys for decoding. Those keys would be kept in
}escrow houses, requiring "authorized access" to obtain them for
}wiretapping purposes. No one knows what those houses would be or what
}authorization would be required. This is *completely undetermined*.
}It would be easy to make one of them the Treasury and the other the
}Justice department, requiring only a memo from Commerce or the NSA to
}obtain them without even a warrant. Moreover, that particular chip
}would be decodeable *for all time*, not even requiring the expense of
}maintaining the wire tap that occurs with phones now.
}
}There are other issues: would it be exportable, or restricted as DES
}is?  Would a layer of encoding on top of the chip be criminal? Would
}it be the only permitted encoding for phone systems? There are more,
}but I hope you get the idea.
}
}Feel free to quote me if this is the most coherent answer you get.

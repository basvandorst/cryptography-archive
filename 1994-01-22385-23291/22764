Hello,

Thanks for taking the time to read this message. I am doing some background
research into the security of data  Virtual Private Networks or as I have
been told they are called Virtual Corporate Networks in the US. I have
managed to identify a number of organisations that provide this service to
customer sites. These include,

US Sprint - SDDN
AT&T      
MCI
British Telecom
SIP Italy
Norwegian telecom
RTT Belgium
(If there are others missing from this list can you tell me)

However I have unfortaunately been unable to get any information on the name
of the service they offer and the type of security they provide on these data
systems. 
As this information may be regarded to be 'private', etc, ; the main reason 
for this research is to generate a picture on the current status of virtual
 private networks  around the world. Therefore the information I require is
NOT very detailed but just says whether authentication is used, access control,
confidentiality, etc. If you think that you can help, please E-mail me. Again
I thank you for taking the time to read this message.

Regards

Sean O' Connell

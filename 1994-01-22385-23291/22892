OK, so maybe I can de-classify a disk, but I sure cant get this lousy news feed
to behave.
It seems to me that the single most important thing regarding declassifying
disks is to be as sure as you need to be that the data is gone. If you dont
want to physically destroy the disks, then you've got to be pretty sure that
the the cost to your company of someone unauthorised gaining access to your
data is less than the replacement cost of your device. I worked for an
organisation that considered the only acceptable way fo guaranteeing the data
was gone was for a trusted employee to physically remove the drive or media
under supervision and then incinerate it.
Call me paranoid, but technology has a nast habit of improving. A
classification system for data 10 years ago is worthless now. I'm sure system
managers and other affected personnel would be far happier knowing that
confidential information was being reduced to ash & gas, than maybe sitting and
waiting on a disk somewhere to re-appear when retrieval methods improve.

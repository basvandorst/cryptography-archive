I watched the Nova Codebreakers episode this week just past, and could
probably build my own Enigma cypher machine now from what they showed
of its operation.

HOWEVER, I still don't feel I have a clue as to how the Japanese Purple
machine logically operated.  Only that they ingeniously built it out of
telephone stepping relays which could operate very quickly.

So just how does the Purple code machine operate?

You don't need p to log on. You only need p' to correctly respond to a
challenge and be authenticated. Since recovering p' is trivial, the
scheme is not strong.

<on> X <hex> <xor> X <dec> is not even a good one-way function, as it
is linear over (GF(2))^n (n = # bits). It can be inverted with
Gaussian elimination in O(n^2) time. (i.e. under a millisecond for
your 10-digit numbers).

If you were to put up $50 for finding p, I'd crunch the numbers :-).

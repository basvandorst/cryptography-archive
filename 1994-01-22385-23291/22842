	On the contrary, it is something that hoplophobes talk
	and write about a great deal. They usually do so from
	a position of ignorance, however, claiming that the
	National Guard (which did not exist prior to the 20th
	Century) is the "militia".

<This seems to imply that
<only when people are part of a state run, regulated militia (i.e. kind of
<sounds like the National Guard) are they allowed to keep and bear arms.
 
	Yes, and only people who work for the government are allowed
	to be "secure in their papers" as Amendment 4 acknowledges,
	and the rules against self-incrimination in Amendment 5 only
	refer to employees of the state as well.

	But one must wonder why, if "the people" so obviously refers
	to "the state", the writers of the Bill of Rights chose
	to use different words for "the States" and "the people".

<Personally, I think that everyone is going about this the wrong way. 
	
	So do a lot of us. Rather than disarming potential victims,
	in the hope that this will somehow affect criminals (who,
	among other things, break *gun laws* as well as laws against
	rape, robbery and murder) there are many folks who think
	we ought to start enforcing the laws that already exist.

<I think that if we want to solve the "armed crime problem" we ought to ban the
<sale and manufacture of ammunition...

	Ah, another follower of Senator "how dry I am" Monyhan. 
	WIll this regulation affect criminals? Hmm, would anyone
	care to speculate that organized crime has already stockpiled
	considerable amounts of handgun, shotgun and even rifle
	ammo? And that they will continue to sell it in "rented"
	firearms?
	
	And given that the police and military have been shown to be
	so "porous" with regard to firearms (See DC "CUE" study
	by ATF/DC PD and news reports on stolen military guns),
	is it reasonable to expect that what affects the law abiding
	citizen will affect the criminal class?

<Or at least tax it to death so that it
<becomes extremely expensive to use guns to fire projectiles.
 
	So the thousands of rounds of ammunition expended *every
	week* in this country in hunting and competitive shooting
	somehow are to blame for the criminal misuse of a few?

	Please explain how this can be so.
	
<Of course, the NRA and its' supporters will argue that criminals will
<simply steal what they want.  

	That seems to be a reasonable assertion.
	
<That's true...Criminals will also continue to 
<escape from prisons, continue to kill police officers, and continue to 
<manipulate the legal system to their advantage no matter what laws are passed 
<(or loopholes closed).
 
	But there is no legitimate use for prison escapes and killing
	of police officers, so even the most diehard NRA member will
	support the existing laws against same.

	There *is* a great deal of legitimate use of ammunition in
	the US every day, and it is quite absurd to assert that
	an Olympic competitor practicing free pistol is somehow
	in any way associated with crime...or that taking her gun
	and ammunition away will somehow stop armed robberies.

	It is grossly simplistic to assert or even imply that banning
	the hunting of ducks with shotguns will somehow affect 
	drive by shootings.

	Yet that is what this "argument" amounts to.

<With that arguement, I can even dismiss the NRA's proposal to put more
<police officers on the street by saying criminals will simply use stolen guns 
<and ammunition to kill police officers who attempt to pursue them.
 
	Excuse me? How does this follow? 

<I suppose that what I am saying here is that the problem is deeper than
<availiblity of arms and/or ammunition, or even laws.  The problem is with our
<society.  We've built a society which is numb to and tolerant of violence.
  
	To a certain extent, this is true. How would banning all hunting
	change that?
	
<But then I really don't care about gun laws, as I don't even own a gun, and
<if the police have nothing better to do than watch me all the time and sift
<through my private communications, then they can waste their time.  

	How about if they break down doors and ransack houses, based
	on "tips" about illegal objects?

	And do this several times?

	Would this bother Harmon?


<What worries me is when private indiviuals and companies start to take 
<an interest in my private life.
	
	Uh, what is an off-duty bureaucrat but a private individual?

	It's strange that Harmon is worried about individuals, who
	have names and addresses and can be sued, but finds no
	problem in a Big Brother state.

<Please do this via followups and not by email, as I don't
<even suscribe to this newsgroup and am simply responding to this post because
<it was posted on sci.crypt (talk about an inappropriate place to post 
<something  political).

	Ah, a "drive-by" posting, eh? Well, let's just provide
	Harmon with a chance to see this response.

	The followup is set OUT of sci.crypt.

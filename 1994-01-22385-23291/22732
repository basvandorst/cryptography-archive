I see a problem with that! As published, the RSA patent was very restricted, so it is
 no problem to invent an RSA - like algorithm which is not covered by the patent. Take
 for instance an RSA over Gaussian integers (i.e. complex numbers a+bi, with integer a
 and b). "Lucas sequnces" have a similar flavour, since they hid integers in quadratic
 fields - of which the Gaussian integers are a special case.

To my understanding - from articles published in this group - however, the company now
 owning the public key patents (RSA, Diffie hellman, etc.) has a much laxer patent
 designed to cover virtually any published or unpublished cryptosystem using number
 theoretical functions and based on the difficulty of either factoring or taking
 discrete logarithms.

Has anybody read that patent or know how it is available ?

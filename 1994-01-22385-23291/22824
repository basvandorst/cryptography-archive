I don't see proving the goodness of crypto signatures as such a problem.
Wouldn't the court rely on expert testimony?  I mean, the courts aren't 
interested in the details of accounting, and in cases involving accounting
doesn't the court let the accountants hash it out?  Basically, an expert
swears "Yep, it's good" or "No it ain't".  

Crypto evidence has been used to send criminals to jail.  I refer to 
Elizebeth Friedman's expert testimony on Government decrypts of booze
smugglers during Prohibition.  I'm sure the Court didn't try to solve the
intercepts for itself, but relied on E. Friedman's expertise.

: OTOH in British courts I can't see any problem is signing a computer audit
: file with PGP, and (using PGP to verify the signature) testifying that it
: is valid and accurate, in the same way I can for printed or written documents.
: (I believe the rules on computer evidence were relaxed a little last year).

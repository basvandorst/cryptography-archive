   Why hasn't there been made any serious attempts to extend DES?

I assume you're talking about extending the design to a more
complicated design, rather than extending the lifetime of the standard...

   According to Michael J. Wiener, the strength of two-key
   triple-DES is 10^{13} times that of single-DES (~43 bits
   stronger). This means that for a 200% increase in CPU time
   you get a 76% increase in effective key length.

That's probably about right, barring unforeseen theoretical
complications, NSA publishing their backdoor, etc. :-)
That means it takes 10**13 or 2**43 times as long to break 2-key 3-DES
as regular DES, which means with Wiener's (unbuilt) keysearch machine,
you'll need about 10**6 years to break it.  Not too shabby.

There *have* been a number of attempts to extend DES or its (published
or reengineered) design principles to better algorithms.
It turns out to be difficult to improve without major redesign,
and there's still the lingering suspicion of NSA backdoors.
Simple approaches often weaken it rather than strengthening it,
and don't solve the problem of defeating differential cryptanalysis.
Bruce Schneier's book on Applied Cryptography devotes a reasonably
long section to discussing extensions of DES.
Some of the things people have done are to double the effective
blocksize, requiring about 4-5 calls of basic DES,
and to play around with more rounds of S-box, etc.

The alternative approach is to do major redesigns (e.g. IDEA, Khufu etc.)
and try to use software-friendly operations instead of
hardware-oriented bit-twiddling.

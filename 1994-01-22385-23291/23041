Do you mean by this that all the programs on the CD-ROM are encrypted
with the same key, so if I order one program I can decrypt them all?  This
seems silly, so I suspect you mean that each CD-ROM is the same, so program
X on Alice's CD-ROM is encrypted with the same key as program X on Bob's
CD-ROM.

Paying a lot for the key would be incentive to some to try and recoup
their money by selling the key to others.  Sell it for 10% of what you
paid for it, but sell it 20 times.  You even make money on the deal!

This presumably answers a question I've had for a while, but I'll ask it
anyway :-)  Is there a unique serial number on a CD-ROM, or is it possible
to put one there?  I know how CD-ROMs (and CDs in general) are pressed, and
I could see where it might be difficult to do this, but certainly not
impossible.  It would eliminate the problem of reselling (or giving away,
or stealing) keys.

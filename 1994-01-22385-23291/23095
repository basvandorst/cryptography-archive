In "The American Magic" (1982), Ronald Lewin quotes an unnamed source as
saying

    Purple was not an Enigma... there were no Enigma type wheels
    involved.  The basic ingredient was telephone selectors/wipers (waipaa
    in Japanese) such as could be found in any dial telephone system of
    that date...  A wiper unit was six levels wide and twenty-five steps
    long.  Normally one level was used for the stepping control and the
    other five for the substitution matrix... division of the alphabet
    into 20/6..  Whatever 6 letters were plugged into the plugboard to the
    "vowel" positions enciphered only amongst themselves, and similarly
    for the "consonant" positions.  This was the Achilles' heel of the
    machine...

And so on.  I think there's still not enough data in the description (which
is longer than "fair use") to allow reconstructing one of 'em.

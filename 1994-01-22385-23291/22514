I don't say this story is genuine. But if it is, and the fellow has a way to
crack RSA, he can make a lot more money selling it than publishing it.
What's more, if he solved Rivest's challenge, he'd be shooting himself in
the foot by announcing, in effect, that he'd broken RSA, and people would
rather quickly stop using it for anything valuable.

Thus he may have reconsidered making info available publicly.

Hell, If I had an invention like that, I could probably get a lot of money by
selling it directly to NSA, while remaining a loyal and trusted citizen.
Let's see--the last time I heard anything like this, the NSA was apparently
willing to pay expunging one's past records, a nice big Winnebago, a first
class all expenses trip to Europe, including that ever-popular European
country Tahiti, and an undertaking to try to bring peace on earth and good
will to men (despite "We're the U.S. Government. We're not in that
business.") Mary was also willing to give up her phone number.

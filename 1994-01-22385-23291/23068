This thread had a message (now expired at my site) about "approved bit 
patterns" for use in scrubbing disks. I think something about "14" of them
were mentioned.  Can anyone point me towards a source that has more
info on this subject?

[I wrote a quick program last night to create a file full of zero bits
 until EONOSPC then re-write it with 1 bits and unlink - how does that
 stack up against these so-called approved bit patterns?]

Please reply via email if possible.

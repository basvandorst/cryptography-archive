Wasn't the secrecy possibly to conceal the fact that NSA had differential
cryptanalysis down well before it was 'discovered'?

If I was running an agency like that, and had discovered a new technique
I wouldn't want to let it be known, either, lest opponents figure it out
and start making their systems resistant to it.   For whatever reason,
the NSA and IBM wanted a standard that was strong, but only SO strong.
Yet, known to have a given strength.  Whatever the reason, it was seen
in both NSA's and IBM's best interest to have that algorithm out there.

It was only available in hardware, was virtually unknown outside data
security circles, so it was apparantly presumed to be safe.

It appears motives are considerably different in the trapdoor chip
they are pushing now.  Good systems exist, which can be presumed to
be defeated with at least enough difficulty it would have to be a
very important case, indeed.  They want something that is accessed
with no effort to be used by the bulk of the population.  I feel
if the bulk of the people of interest start using strong crypto
without trapdoors, the 'assurance' of not trying to ban non-escrowed
crypto will go right out the window.

Government agencies have not been averse to breaking promises or their
word in the past, nor are they bothered by ignoring the Constitution,
either (if they can get away with it, and they usually can, if caught,
nothing really happens to those responsible), so we can presume they
are willing to do all that presently.  Assuming anything else is folly,
IMO.

WAY over my head here.  Sounds nice, though... a property that would
be an asset in any encryption scheme - too weak?  Up the rounds, etc.
and accept lower throughput (offset by hotter CPUs)...  :-)

I have a friend who worked for a cellular carrier. All the calls from
all the cell sites are routed through just a few main trunks to
landlines. Programming the system to grab the calls of a select customer
and listening/recording is trivial. Actually, we did it a few times
while sitting at his office at night. Just checking the noise levels on
random lines, I assure you....

It's amazing what people talk about on the phone.

   This maybe really a stupid thing to say, but why would you want to use a

   That would only eliminate the people w/ the scanners.  Otherwise, this 
   system is equivalent to no encryption at all, since the conversation goes 
   un-encrypted through the phone lines, so anyone can still tap the phone 
   line and listen.

Yes, but it does keep Bad Guys from listening to your conversations
with radios.  Most Bad Guys don't wiretap phone lines (especially Bad
Guys who are cops, since there are rules about cops doing that sort of
thing), but many of them use radios to listen for interesting stuff.

Wiretaps, of course, are covered by the Drug Exception to the 4th Amendment :-)

The above is very misleading.  It is no *illegal* to export cryptos; 
crypto exports are *regulated*.   Like many other things.

Further, even in those cases where regulatory approval for a crypto
export is not obtained, there is no "crippling of workstation exports", 
or crippling of any other system-level exports.  One simply exports 
the system without its crypto, and then integrates a foreign crypto 
once off-shore.  This is extremely routine.

The only industry conceivably impacted is the crypto indutry, not
the workstation industry.  And, the domestic crypto industry is
pretty healthy.

Finally, the export restrictions are only vaguely related to the
clipper proposals, which are mainly aimed at domestic use.

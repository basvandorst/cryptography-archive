This is a little off-base.  Clipper is one of a number of NSA 
attempts to have more presence in the privacy (commercial) end of the
encryption business.

I see it more as part of the overall trend to commercialize
government technologies.  But I am somewhat cynical; I believe there
is some empire-building at work, and I also believe the law
enforcement community has made some headway in co-opting, if
not NSA, then the Administration's direction of NSA... which
is Not Good News, as I've pontificated before.

(Doesn't PGP embed the RSA algorithm?  And was there some
government money used for that?)

Often, entrepreneurs do not want government money, because
(a) attention is distracted from filling the needs of the marketplace 
to meeting contract requirements and such; and/or (b) the
government ends up with some rights to the product that
the entrepreneurs do not wish to give up.

However, I do not see why a PGP development would not 
be a reasonable funded activity.  Try an SBIR.

I think it has some value.  For example, a business might choose
to use Clipper, rather than something unescrowed, for company
communications over public networks.  This would discourage
employees from using the system for illegal activity.

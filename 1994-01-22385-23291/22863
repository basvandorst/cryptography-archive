Another inflammatory attempt to start a flame war. I was not talking about
civil disobedience. Businesses who try civil disobedience with respect to the
crypto and arms control laws will see just how far they get. I believe we
have a current worked example or two, and as far as I know the parties
involved weren't even DELIBERATELY trying civil disobedience.

With respect to businesses who aren't trying civil disobedience, they may
not pick and choose, as I've said above, any more than they may pay only
part of their taxes if they don't like how some of it is spent.

As for the rest, see the matter following "EXCEPT".

Hum! I am working on a similar problem (for my self) - still research
phase tho'.

If say IW is your input word, OW your output word then if

OW =  ( { [ IW XOR Key1 ] +AddLeftToRt Key2} +AddRtToLeft Key3)

and if need be iterate more than once then you will not be
needing a one-time pad or code-book.  On the other hand there are
some cycle properties that are there in the output - relevance of which
I have not yet understood for cryptanalysis.

On an earlier posting on this process there was a concern 
(appologize :( forgot the poster) regarding the properties of
Avalanche (a single input bit chaning max output bits...).  Well
with the second reverse addition step this is exactly what is achieved.
It is evident from the generation and the propogation of the carry bit.
(am still working on better way of expression of details).

For real security tho (not very conveneint to do with paper and
pencil - or on the back of an envelope) one can use an LFSRG
(linear feedback shift register) at the output - so that no
patterns can be isolated and attributed any individual stages.

Commnets / Pros / Cons will be greatly appreciated. Oh! BTW
I call this system RSK (Ram Shyam Key after my old maternal+paternal ones)

Will provide further details if this has not bored you to death.

It's been some time since I read the Arms Export and Import Control Act
and the ITAR, so I might be shaky here and there.

First, the purpose of the Act which has very little to do with crypto.
Its purpose is to give the President a powerful inducement for our
foreign policy.  The idea is that American arms are very desirable, and
that the President can make the availability of them depend on some
other government pleasing us.  

This is not a law to be screwed with.  Congress wrote it, and as I read 
it, Congress meant it.  Almost anything you can think of dealing with arms
and export is an export controlled by this Act.  Yes, it is an export for
somebody to take the knowledge solely in his head to a foreign country and
make use of it there without a license.  The summary of case law on this Act 
explains this very point.  Somebody had taken knowledge of LST (if I 
remember right.  An LST is a Naval vessel) construction solely in his 
head, and set up business building LSTs in Portugal.  He was convicted 
and the conviction was upheld.

I think most of us (maybe not our transborder colleagues) would have no
objections to the general thrust of this law.  It mostly concerns 
obviously military items, space items, and the like.  Things that I can 
accept that the Government wishes to control.

The trouble is crypto.  Even here, we should try to keep a sense of
proportion.  In the first place, this law originates in the Military
Security Act (I think it was), written in about 1950.  Most crypto
in those days was indeed military.  Unfortunately, there was no
distinction made between truly military crypto and Orphan Annie 
decoder rings.  Still, I think it is fair to say that in 1950 crypto
was military.

Second, crypto is one of the lesser items controlled by this Act.  Items 
deemed sensitive are listed in the Munitions List with an asterisk, and
crypto doesn't have one.  It's classified under "Auxiliary Military
Equipment", the 13th class.  It ranks in importance with metal
embrittling agents and "certain" chemiluminiscent compounds.
Basically, crypto has outgrown this Act.

Another problem area is "technical data" because of its obvious potential
for conflict with the 1st Amendment.  Here, if I read the case law 
summary right, the court has narrowly restricted the meaning of technical 
data (Edler vs US?) in order to keep the law alive.  Otherwise the Ninth 
Circuit Court would have had to invalidate the Act.  It's clear to me 
that the NSA is stretching the meaning of the Act way beyond the Ninth 
Circuit Court's limits by trying to restrain publication of crypto.

The Act does not apply to concepts.  Congress was apparently concerned 
about this application, and specifically exempts general science, 
engineering, and math.  

My guess is, that the NSA uses the crypto provision of this Act for 
obscure reasons of its own, and which are different from the purpose
of the Act.  Otherwise, it would not be that hard to get the Administration
to update the Munitions List.  The only update for crypto was at the NSA's
behest.  The wording was changed from "cryptographic devices" to
"cryptographic devices and software", hardly an improvement.
You would have a tough time convincing me that our foreign policy is
aided by control of DES export.

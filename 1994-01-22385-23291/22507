No, regulation of interstate transport is already covered at the federal
level.  The Feds need only pass a law which states that if a local cop
observes a radar detector in a commercial vehicle, the driver immediately
loses his Federal drivers license (recently enacted to keep bad drivers
from hopping between states) and the company he works for risks losing
*its* Federal business license as well.

It's hard to say.  Some jurisdictions essentially "mine" the traffic
for money, but they risk a backlash from local residents.  (E.g., one
local city had cops sitting just over a rise on an interurban expressway.
Many people, even if they were traveling under 55, reflexively slam on
the brakes when the top a hill and see a cop on the shoulder.  Cars
behind them had no warning, and often nearly rear-ended the previous
cars.  Many people wrote nasty letters to the editor, and I actually
told local businesses that I wouldn't be back because I didn't want
to risk such incompetent cops.  All it would take is one good injury
lawsuit for reckless endangerment for that city to lose all of the money
it made catching speeders.) 

But other jurisdictions don't seem to mind people bending the law a
bit, as long as they're reasonably alert.  For instance, the cop would
park in a fairly visible place, and ignore cars that slowed down when
they saw him.  But drivers that ignored him, or worse yet drivers that
reacted sharply *after* they passed him, would get nailed.

I saw that near the Mississippi-Alabama line.  When I stopped for
directions earlier, everybody warned me about a "speed trap" just over
the state line.  And nearing the border, I saw a couple big signs
about a "speed trap."  But when I actually reached this town, it
had the conventional "ramp down" and warning signs -- it wasn't a
speed trap in the conventional sense (e.g., a road with a 55 mph
speed limit dropping without warning to 25 mph, with a cop right
at the speed limit sign); anyone who was paying *any* attention
would realize that the speed limit was dropping because the road
was going through a town.

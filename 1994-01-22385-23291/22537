Bzzzt.

Suppose my banker/doctor/mayor/drug dealer/lover/business acquaintance/...
chooses to use it to transmit information about me?  Not much choice of
mine involved there.  Facts not in evidence?  No facts at all about the
future, on either side.  But, gut check time--if Clipper phones were to
be in widespread use, what is the likelihood that information about you,
me, or any run-of-the-mill user of the net would *never* be transmitted
over a Clipper-secure [sic] channel?

There is no great leap involved in expecting that the outcome of this
policy process involves many who may never buy a cellular telephone.

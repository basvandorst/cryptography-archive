Ok David, our government is protecting us aganst foreign threats , because
RSA and IDEA is not good enough?
 
I am assuming that you will use the clipper chip, as soon as it come on the
market and throw away your PGP software?

Come on David the government been breaking it own laws for sixty years
to spy on us [see the Puzzle Palace by James Bamford] and had been
doing it very best to keep us from having access to strong programs
like PGP.
 
NSA is our friend and only wish to help us!!!!!!!  For my part NSA can
keep it 'aid' and I will keep PGP and secure drive.

No, the Poles stole no planes. The Poles had a access a commercial Enigma
(without Stecker board) so they knew the principle of the Enigma. With
the help of key lists for several months and with the Instruction Manual
for the German Army Enigma (which had no plans or other information about
the internal working or circuitry) they managed to recover the wiring
of the Enigma and all the rotors that were then in use. Already before
they received the key lists and the manual from the French, they had
recovered the wiring of some of the rotors.

There is a lot of confusion about this part of the Enigma history,
due to the fact that most of the earlier authors that wrote books
about Enigma were completely wrong. Unfortunately all the later work
on Enigma has been published in some rather obscure specialist publications
that are not often recited.

Even Sir Hinsley got the Polish story wrong in Vol.1 of in "British
Intelligence in the Second World War". A correction appeared as an
appendix in Vol.2 or Vol.3.

One good account of the early Enigma history has been written by
Gilbert Bloch.

Another relatively good book on the Polish work is:

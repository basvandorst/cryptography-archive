Perhaps you don't understand the origin of Rights.  Putting it 
simply, Rights come from our Creator.  We, the sovereigns (or 
those with supreme control) then delegated certain rights to 
the government.  They are OUR servants, not the other way 
around.  Perhaps, you just need to tell them that.  (Yes, the 
Supreme Court upholds this.)

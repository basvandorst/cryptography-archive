   I have heard mention of digital currency schemes that can be implemented

   chips that Chaum's plan needs.
Chaum's original digicash systems didn't use observers, but instead
they needed on-line communications with the bank.  The problems they're
trying to solve include how to prevent double-spending; verification
with the bank is one approach, but observers are another.  Without
something like that, it's hard to prevent the spender from using the
same digicoin twice, since software-only solutions are easily tampered with.

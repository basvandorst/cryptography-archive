The front page of today's Washington Post (Monday, Jan 24)
has an article about the NSA's (relatively) new museum
located behind a Shell station in a defunct motel surrounded
by a chain-link fence just off the Baltimore-Washington Parkway.

Apparently, the museum "held the first opening in July and
didn't tell the public.  It held a second ribbon-cutting
last month for the public but didn't tell the press."  It's
open 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Mon-Fri.  Call 301-688-5849

The article is mostly fluff, but worth reading.

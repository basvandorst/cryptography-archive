There is also a newer implementation in C. 

Note: I have intentionally *not* written a complete public key system 
based on LUC, but just a prototype for those interested in seeing 
relatively naive code for LUC and comparing performance with RSA. 
Many things are missing that would go into a real public key system 
like PGP, RIPEM, PEM. If you are interested in using public key 
cryptography, please get one of these. 

Anyway, anon ftp to wimsey.bc.ca:/pub/crypto/software
read the README file and if you agree to the conditions

cd dist/US_or_Canada_only_????????/LUC

get l3-1.1b.tar.gz (don't forget binary mode)

and the GNU GMP library (1.3.2) or FGMP 1.0 if you need it.

The distribution consists of source for a few Unix systems. I
don't claim any copyright on any part of it. 

Please respect the distribution control mechanism on wimsey.bc.ca, 
and don't try and export or distribute any of this software 
illegally (with respect to Canadian law).

There isn't going to be any more development on this. I've 
frozen L3 at this version.

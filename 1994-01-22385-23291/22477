   Nobody made the "easy or cheap" assertion. Thus your attempted counter is a
   straw man. How about addressing the assertions that were made?

It's possible to fly to the moon.  It's not easy or cheap.  Wonder why
we're not doing it any more?

   As for "generally practical" it is you who are not in touch with the facts,
   since the proof of practicality is the profitable existence of such multiple
   systems.

Now you, as opposed to Steve Pope (who at least has some relevant
experience even if he doesn't realize that large, user-accessible
software packages differ qualitatively from embedded systems) have
precious little business talking about this issue AT ALL.  You have
demonstrated NO knowledge related to the software release process
whatsoever.  Sure, for a word processor that will sell a million copies,
it's feasible to do multiple releases, if a bit unpleasant.  For more
complex packages, with more limited distribution and more complex
interactions between various system components, doing this is well-nigh
impossible without raising the price of the product tremendously.  The
kind of software that we're talking about does not have the kind of
cushy profit margin that enables us to hire lots of people and buy lots
more machines for doing the extra releases you're talking about.

Call me a greedy sniveling elitist profiteering snob if you care to.  I
don't care.  Vernon, Bill, and I have explained this issue, and you'll
notice that we've all had much the same experiences.  If you have more
questions, and you ask them without insinuating that I'm a communist or
a profiteer, I'll be happy to answer them.

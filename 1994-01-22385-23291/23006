A general purpose IDEA encryption package can be found at:

site: src.doc.ic.ac.uk
 dir: /packages/amiga/util/crypt
file: idea.lha

Although this was written for the Amiga, the original Unix source code
is included and is very easy to understand. You'll need to get lha to
decode it. A dos version can be found in /packages/ibmpc/simtel20/archiver

By the way, perhaps this reference ought to be in the FAQ ? It seems to be
asked quite often.

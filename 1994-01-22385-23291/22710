No apologies are necessary.  You did not /interfere/, you added to the
discourse.  Outside views are badly needed in this country (USA) where
political discourse is frighteningly narrow and rhetorical.

And besides, since the US has set itself up as the world's top gun and
political policeman, I believe that every human being on this planet
should have a right to a voice in it's government.  ;-)  But that's
neither here nor there...

   I think you're missing the main point of signatures based on public key
   cryptography.  You don't need the private key (thus you don't need to
   trust in "honesty in discovery") to verify a signature, only the public key.

They probably were missing it, but there's still an important legal problem -
verifying that the public key in some key server allegedly belonging
to 'J.R.Signer' really does belong to that person.  Either a hierarchical
or web-of-trust system can help with that process, though neither one
can prove that the signer is the *only* person with access to that key.

Also, in typical PGP use, I suspect most people verify that the person
who is giving them a key is the person they claim to be, and that they
got the correct key (using fingerprints or whatever), but don't
actually verify that the person claiming it's their key really has the
private key, e.g. by having them sign a nonce and verifying the signature.
For the most part, it's not real critical (the main effect is
that the alleged key-owner gets mail she can't read), but a
large-scale campaign of this sort could make data from key-servers
less useful.

Hello.  Excuse me for jumping in the conversation, but the topic is something I
am currently working on.  Also excuse me because I'm a novice at RSA type
encryption.  Would you be able to explain, or tell me where to find a
description of how (generalistic
ally or precisely) the method works?  from what I've read, you take E (odd
number), and P and Q (primes).  get N by multiplying Q and P, and then find D
by taking (p-1)(q-1)(e-1)+1 all divided by E.  Then doing character to the E-th
power, mod N.  then ene
crypted character to the d-th power, mod N.  I have tried this with
significantly small values of the numbers (E as 5, P as 3 and Q as 5), and the
method doesn't work.  I would try larger values, but my computer tends to not
like things such as 66 to the 7
7th power mod 35.. (at least I haven't found the method to do this yet.)
 
thanks much! 8)  have fun.

Barry , I been hoping that my post would show that there is enough of an
interests, in sending PGP and Secure drive to Congress, to made it possible.
 
I had already sended my three congress persons a disk, with a cover letter
and as there is 535 members of congress we would need a group of twenty to
thirty members to cover them all, IE between 26 to 18 letters with disks
apiece.
 
Ok people, is there enough of an interest in doing this or not?
 
Post or semd me e-mail and if we get anywhere near enough of a group
together, I would be more then willing to do my share to get this off
the ground.

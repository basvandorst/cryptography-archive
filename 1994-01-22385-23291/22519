                         TITLES TO 2700 SOFTWARE PATENTS
                             ISSUED IN 1992 and 1993

    In January and February, the Patent Office is holding hearings in San Jose
and Washington on the "problem" of software patents.  The hearings will focus
on two aspects: the nature of software patents (legal, economic and software
theory), and the process of awarding software patents (in particular, software
prior art).  To help these hearings be more empirical, I have prepared a list
of 2700 software patents issued in the past two years.  It should help people
base assertions in the actual statistics of issued software patents (of which
there are over 11,000).

     The patents listed below were issued in all of 1992 and the first half of
1993.  The list is based on what I consider to be a software patent, though it
does reflect the nature of software patenting in the US, and does include
software patents from all categories of software for which patents are being
sought.  And given the Patent Office's classification scheme for software
(which they are revising), this was not a very easy list to compile.

     Despite the tremendous numbers of software patents being issued (with
respect to the small numbers of true software innovations each year), software
patenting as of yet is not a really big socioeconomic problem, though unless
the software community acts now, it will become a big problem.

     A series of diskettes with more detailed information on each software
patent listed below (full title, number, assignee, abstract, classification,
application date) are available for $595.  Also provided are diskettes with
9000 titles from my software prior art database, and version 1.0 of my patents
claim analysis program.  Proceeds go to my project of making the Patent Office
APS patent text files Internet accessible.

     For more information on the Internet Patent News Service, send  'help'
in the body of a message to   patents@world.std.com   on the Internet.

==============================================================================

     I use 42 categories of software patents, listed below, though a few are
so big that I will probably split them up.  Some patents are listed in more
than one category to simplify your search for relevant patents.  Many of the
titles have been abridged without losing their meaning, to fit on one line.
Some titles start with '--'.  This indicates the assignee is IBM.  I do this
because IBM has 1/8 of all software patents, has made money off its software
patents, and it is interesting to see their software patenting strategy.

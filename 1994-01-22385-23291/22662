No need to read further, right?  The *assumption* is clearly controversial,
as even David seems to agree.

Notice that the *implicit* assumption, that the "design" we're told about
is the same as the actual design of the system, is also controversial -- so
even in stating this assumption, it might have been clearer to say:

	Thus, assuming the system works as *advertised* ...

Of course, unless the advertisement included some sort of guarantee,
such as a binding congressional vote agreeing that anyone could sue the
US government for (say) $100 million if the system did *not* work as
advertised, then the advertised behavior is probably worth as much as
any of Clinton's other promises.

I've no idea if clipper costs more than $100 million, but 
normally a manufacturer engaging in false advertising must at least 
give you your money back.

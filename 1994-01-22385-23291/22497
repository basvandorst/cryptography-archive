One method that immediately comes to mind is the sting.

The feds would place ads in magazines for non-skipjack
telephones, and such, and establish lists of suspects
from the respondents.

It's an old tactic of theirs... they've done this to
catch pot growers, methedrine chemists, and child porno
readers.

Stupid as it sounds, they actually catch people this
way.  Including some who are innocent...

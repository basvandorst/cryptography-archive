This sounds far too broad.  I would guess it's far more specific--somewhere
along the lines of use of modular exponentiation with a modulus
consisting of the product of two primes for cryptographic purposes.

Modular arithmetic was not at all new to cryptography when RSA was
developed, so the patent would *have* to be much narrower than just that.

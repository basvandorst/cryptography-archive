As for (1), I don't have a copy of Zierler & Brillhart, but what you
quote is not a contradiction.

A primitive polynomial p over a ring R is an irreducible polynomial
the root of which is a primitive element in the extension field, i.e.,
the root \alpha has the property that R[x]/(p)=R(\alpha).

This property is important to LFSRs because of what we get when we
take R=Z_2 and look at the sequence 1, x, x^2, ..., x^k, ..., etc, all
modulo p.  Since in extension fields we identify the indeterminate x
with \alpha, we see that the sequence is exactly what \alpha will
generate, which is the entire field when E=Z_2[x]/(p), p a primitive
polyn.  Since we know that [E:Z_2] = n = deg(p), E has 2^n elements in
it.  Excluding the zero polyn, we see that the period must be 2^n-1 --
the sequence must cycle through all elements of E except for 0 (x^m
can not be 0, because otherwise x=\alpha would be a zero divisor,
contradicting the fact that E is a field).  An LFSR generates just the
coefficient to the x^0 term of this sequence.

Does anyone know if there's a proof that the low coefficient of this
2^n-1 period sequence also has the same period?

If T_{n,k}(x) are just irreducible but not nec'y primitive, then we
don't know the period of the LFSR -- that would depend on the initial
conditions, since there is more than one cycle.

Dunno about (2).

ps: while this is not (yet) a cryptography question, at least it's not
patent flamage or some such, and the mathematics can have
cryptographic applications.  The signal-to-noise of sci.crypt has been
really low lately....

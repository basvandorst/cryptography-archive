   BTW, somebody of the gurus here mentioned to me that it is possible to
   use the DNS mechanism to distribute some additional information about
   your machines. Maybe this could be use to distribute the public keys
   of your local users... Would be nice if it is so - the DNS mechanism
   works rather well... Could somebody with more knowledge on that
   subject verify whether it can be achieved?

Fascinating.  I never thought of that!  As time goes on, I fear that
my brain is getting ever mushier.

In Athena, at least, hesiod is used to distribute information around a
network.  I can type, for instance, "hesinfo pcl passwd" and get back
the response "pcl:*:9512:101:Paul C Leyland,,,,:/das/pcl:/bin/csh"

Hesiod uses the DNS mechanism.

I will investigate further.  In particular, I could use "hesinfo pcl
pgpkey" and have it do the decent thing.

Mark Henderson, writing from Canada, advises a Bulgarian National
writing from Germany on how to get the RSAREF and RIPEM files
without reading or agreeing to the license agreement.

I think this is both a disgrace and a violation of ITAR. I would
not be surprised if it is also a violation of Canadian Law.

RSA has been trying to make RIPEM/RSAREF freely available to
U.S. users, within their patent and the Munitions Laws. By
revealing how to get the files without agreeing to the license,
or even reading it, Mark has likely spoiled it for the rest of us.

Shame!

Since I take this personally, given the efforts of many to provide a
free, usable, legal public key system for non-commercial use in the
U.S. I have copied Mark's message to the President of RSA, for what
action he may wish to take.

Is RSA patented in the US or copyrighted? The reason I ask is a lecturer here who does
a course on patents is interested it having a look at the patent. I don't what to
talk about the legal problems etc etc etc,I just would like to get a copy of the docs,
can someone send me a copy? I will pay if need be.

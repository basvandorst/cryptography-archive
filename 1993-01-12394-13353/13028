Hmmm... and there's a general purpose response from the disgruntled
employee when s/he gets the letter from the firm's attorney:

	(no it's not what you're thinking...  *grin*)

	It's "Huh? Oh gee, I'm sorry I left those protected, but I've
forgotten the passwords to them....I'd be willing to help you try to
figure them out, but I have to spend my time looking for a new job sinc
e you fired me/I have to be at work in the morning and can't afford the
time off to help you out"

A proper tool would then be a bank money order of some substantial
amount as a "reminder", or "temporary employee payroll check"...

This concept may irritate a lot of people (including me...), but let's
face it -- that's the way many people operate...

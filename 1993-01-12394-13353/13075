There was an interesting article in the Science section of the 12 January
New York Times.  It described some situations where using pseudo-
random number generators for simulations gave the *wrong answers*.
Improbable?  Sure.  But it happened.  (And of course, this query was
in sci.crypt, where the need for true randomness has a totally different
foundation.)

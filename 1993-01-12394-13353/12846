One man's nerd is another man's skilled technician.

I found the TeX content readable, and it has the added advantage of
being printable/viewable with any TeX implementation... meaning that
the mathematical material (with super- and subscripting, etc. intact)
is much easier to read than in, say, FORTRAN.

Given the not-strictly-textual content of Stephen's message, I applaud
his use of TeX. Just wait for Carousel!

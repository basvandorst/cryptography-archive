I dunno anything about the security stuff, but you can use the existing
Internet time infrastructure to keep all your system clocks synch'd within 
small fractions of seconds.  Newsgroup comp.protocols.time.ntp is devoted
to discussions of the Network Time Protocol.  NTP includes some confidentiality
and authentication mechanisms.  Software to implement NTP version 3 is
in the XNTP3 distribution that is freely distributable from louie.udel.edu
via anonymous ftp.  This works on most workstations today and is nicely
portable code.

: I'm planning to use DES in CBC mode as a Hash function,

This is a very weak scheme.  This is because of the "birthday
paradox", which means that to generate a pair of messages with the
same hash only requires sqrt(n) operations.  In the case of the DES,
this is 2^28 (less than 10^9.)

If you want security, you should use a function which generates a 128
bit hash.

: known weakness using a zero key with DES?

The all zero key in DES is explicitly forbidden because keys are
required to have odd parity.  The nearest thing is the key
0101010101010101, which is one of the "weak keys".  One of the
features of a weak key is that encryption and decryption are the same
operation; this is something of a weakness in a hash function.  A full
explanation of weak and semi weak keys can be found in Meyer and
Matyas' "CRYPTOGRAPHY: a new dimension in data security."

I recommend the use of MD4 or MD5 for such an application.

Andrew.

Reprint the page in question and the cover of the magazine. Remove the
cover and melt/dissolve the binding glue. Replace the page. Replace
the cover. Rebind. I can't say that I've ever done this, but I don't
see that it wouldn't be possible, especially given some practice
developing the technique. Then all you have to do is replace the
particular subscriber's copy of the magazine with the one you want
them to get and you are done.

If you are communicating something that is worth more than
intercepting the key will cost, its worth someone's while to go
through the trouble to intercept it even if it requires contortions.

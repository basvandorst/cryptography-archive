   It seems to me that permuting the order of characters [bytes] in an
encrypted file would be valuable in hiding the structure, e.g. fixed
headers, 'magic' characters, etc., which might otherwise facilitate a
"chosen plain-text" decryption attack.
   To that end, can anyone offer guidance on efficient algorithms which 
can generate file-length permutations which could be seeded by a password?

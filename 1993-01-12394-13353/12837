I have some expereience with spread spectrum so I'm not an expert and
you will find more knowledgeable people to answer these questions too.
But, here is my cut on these questions.

In (1) frequency hopping by itself does not increase range at all and in
my expereience it can reduce range and raise the burst interference rate
to unacceptable levels. Note that your quote does say that interference 
will be miminized and that will be true provided that a majority of
the channels the unit visits are available for use. Otherwise you
get a lot of burst type interference. Figuring large in any such 
calculation is the hop rate which is not given. 

In (2) you ask about synchronization. Its fair to say that this has always
been a difficult issue for spread spectrum systems and there are many, many
schemes that have been designed over the years to synchronize  such signals.
Many synchronziation procedures are usually designed to overcome some 
specific problem, for example military communicators do not want their
equipment to  be falsely triggered by uninteneded signals and they
go to special pains in their synchronization procedures to prevent this.
In contrast, in behind-the-enemy-lines type systems the syncrhoziation
preamble signal is designed to avoid  an easy to recognize radio signature.
Law enforcement people hate to wait even a fraction of second while their
FH radios synchronize and they sometimes employ very high precision 
oscillators so they don't have to transmit a synchronization preamble. 
The system stays in synch by tracking a subcarrier transmitted under the 
audio. Drift is usually not bad for up to a half hour. A cheap system I 
know of uses the falling edge of the initial hop (a "home" channel were 
they monitor) to trigger. An then there is the socalled transmitted reference 
systems that transmit a reference signal (or use one already on the air like 
an FM station) to synchronzie. 

I will say that these ATT radios will be harder to intercept then whats 
currently on the market. No mention is made of the basic modulation 
scheme and if it departs from the usual narrow FM, then the radio's
should have better privacy properties then whats out there now.

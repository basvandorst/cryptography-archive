There's been a thread on alt.security which is misinforming in the extreme.
Note the former Subject: line, "Making PGP legal?"... Here's the irony of it:

	DISTRIBUTING PGP 2.1 IS *NOT* ILLEGAL, as long as folks
	follow the export laws, and don't *export* it from the US
	or Canada.  Remember that PGP 2.1 was developed outside of
	the US, and that there are sites like nic.funet.fi which
	have it available for anonymous ftp.  *IMPORTING* PGP 2.1
	IS STILL LEGAL, even in the US.  (Note that some countries
	may not wish their citizens to *have* cryptologic technology,
	and import may there be illegal.)

	USING PGP 2.1 IS *NOT* ILLEGAL, at least not in any nation
	I'm familiar with.  Yes, in the U.S. it is possible that RSA
	may take you to court for doing it, but it's not against any
	*law* to do it.  Their only claim against you would be to
	recover 'damages' to their profits.

	As a North-American, the only thing you're *legally* bound
	not to do is to give stuff like PGP to foreigners.  Big deal!
	They already *have* it!!

To clarify my point, take divorce as an example.  There's nothing *illegal*
about getting a divorce, right?  Still, if one side thinks they're getting
ripped off, they sue the other side for "just compensation".

Likewise, distributing PGP 2.1 (within legal boundaries) isn't *illegal*,
but RSA may think they have grounds upon which to sue you for "damages".

Noting that RSA has released their RSAREF to be licensed at no cost to
non-commercial users, it seems unlikely that they'll actually litigate.
Unless one of you folks is distributing more copies of PGP 2.1 than the
Finnish ftp-site, nic.funet.fi, I really don't see how they could make
a case against you that would hold up in court.

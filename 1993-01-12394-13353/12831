I am the proud owner of a calnet RNG-810 random number generator which
I purchased form Calnet Electronics( A Canadian Company). I have reciently 
written Calnet but by letter returned to me. Since there are many uses 
for random numbers  in crypto, I thought that someone out there might know 
Calnet's address.

A friend of mine posessing a masters in mathematics said that he had heard
and saw a flyer in his local math dept that RSA had been cracked.  I told
him that I thought that this was a load of bunk.  We got into a heated
discussion and he claimed that methods of factoring large composites had
been developed that were several orders of magnitude faster than older
methods.  I told him that this was irrelevant, since you  could generated
arbitrarily large composites to form your key.  Even going 12 orders of
magnitude faster (1 trillion times faster), it could still take easily
several billion years to factor some of the smaller sized keys.  The
question that I have is: am I completely wrong here (ie, have I stuck
my foot and a good portion of my leg in my mouth ;) ?  Personally, I feel
that the NSA posted that flyer to get people to refrain from using something
they are unable to crack ;>

My second question is:  what is the best means available for generating
truly huge primes (200+ digits)?  Fermat and Mercene (sp?) numbers
are NOT secure.

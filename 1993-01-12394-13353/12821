Please get Archie and learn to use it.  I got too many hits to post
here, but it says the one nearest you is on your own host!

iskut.ucs.ubc.ca:/pub/internet-drafts/draft-rsadsi-rivest-md5-02.txt

BTW, it used to be on rsa.com -- but now there is a message there
saying they made it part of RSAREF, which stops many of us from
getting it from them.  Never mind, it's in zillions of places :-)

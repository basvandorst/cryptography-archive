You're assuming that they use all those supercomputers for these routine
jobs.  The last time I saw semi-reliable figures, NSA was also the
largest consumer of semiconductors in the world.  I know what they do
with _some_ of those components, and I'd assume that they use the rest
of them to produce some special purpose hardware tailored for specific
tasks.  Like breaking DES msgs.

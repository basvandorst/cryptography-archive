There seems to be too much possibility for dependence or bias in these.  A
much safer one, which was used to produce the Argonne numbers, is radioactive
counts.  If one only uses the parity of the number of counts over an interval,
the process is quite robust, and a fair amount of dead time even gives a
considerable improvement.

The biggest problem is that the query has a substantial chance of occurring
when the counter is changing, so that the deviation of randomness cannot be
better than about 10^-4 or 10^-5.  But XORs can be used to improve this.

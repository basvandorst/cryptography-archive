So tell me, Peter, do you not know that ** mean exponentiation, that
simple mathematical operators and parentheses have their usual
meaning, and that most functions are self-explanatory, such as ABS(x).
That's all one needs to know to communicate in the context of the
present discussion about Sidelnikov, without any of the arcana (to
many) of TeX. We're not talking about typesetting here, but about
getting a few relatively simple formulas to come out the other end of
the pipe to someone of unknown computer credentials in a way that can
be read easily and immediately.

In my view this discussion is a perfect example of the principle that
sometimes the better is the enemy of the good.

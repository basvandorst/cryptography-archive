 Another "likelihood theory":

        What first world government permits the use of DES for the protection 
        of classified material? Does the US government? I believe not.

 And while we are discussing theories, I believe James Bamforth, the NSA 
 watcher, went on record some time ago with a claim that the cost to the US 
 taxpayer for breaking each DES ciphertext is $56. Can anyone supply the  
 assumptions from which he must have made this extrapolation?



.. As for me, all I know is that I know nothing.

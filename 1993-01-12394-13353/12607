Arthur Rubin posts a factually incorrect message echoing Perry
Metzger's assertion that I'm the only one with my position on
ITAR.

I have the e-mail to prove otherwise.

It's a common propaganda technique to try to squelch those with whom
one disagrees by pretending they are somehow alone in their views,
with the implication that "normal" people wouldn't have such views.

Though Metzger's oft-announced extreme political views makes his
post unsurprising, from what I know of Rubin he should know better.

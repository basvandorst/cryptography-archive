Shamir is an Israeli, living in Israel.

Since Shamir is the 'S' in 'RSA', and since you clearly believe that
RSA is not derivative (otherwise it wouldn't qualify for the patent
you defend so strenuously), then there is obviously at least one
non-American who has made at least one significant contribution to
modern cryptography. Another significant Shamir contribution is
differential cryptanalysis, which is rapidly becoming a fundamental
tool in the design of new secret key ciphers.

However, the present state of affairs is claimed to be that the open
discussion and publication of cryptographic algorithms is not export
controlled -- only actual implementations are. Therefore you're
missing the mark by talking about whether non-Americans make
significant contributions to the theory of cryptography. Even if only
Americans made them they'd still be available worldwide.

You ought instead to ask the question whether there are any
non-Americans capable of turning an algorithm description into working
code.  Evidently the US State Department doesn't think so and nor do
you, since you defend this interpretation so strongly.

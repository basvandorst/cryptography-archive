I have an interesting story about frequency hopping.It was actually invented
in 1940 by my father and the movie actress Hedy Lamarr. They wanted to
design a secure radio controlled torpedo.My father and Hedy,being familiar
with player pianos (my father was a composer) had the bright idea of using
two identical player-piano rolls to synchronize the frequencies of an 
independent transmitter and receiver...
Unfortunately this idea was a bit ahead of it's time and the patent expired
before they ever received any money for it.
C' est la vie..

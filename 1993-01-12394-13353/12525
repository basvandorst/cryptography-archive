Curt Welch posts a fascinating explanation of the cracking of the
VCR Plus codes, replacing my speculation and inference with facts--
always welcome.

Good job.

Since some of the movies shown on Cable are of unusual length or
occur at odd times, and since it is convenient to be able to 
tape several shows in sequence without having to back up over
extraneous material at the end (especially if one is away), it would
be a real public service if Curt and his colleagues would find their
way clear to returning to the task for longer numbers.

By the way, I should have realized that one doesn't need published codes
to do the job--just a VCR Plus device and the time to punch in codes.
I'm not clear on one thing, though. The device doesn't tell you the
duration of the program, except to the nearest hour. How does one
determine that part of the coding system without using published
codes?

Finally, I wonder of Curt or any of his colleagues have compiled the
c code for the Mac?

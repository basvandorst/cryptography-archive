For random number generation, you might want to use a software
pseudo random number generator.  They are relatively fast, have
known weaknesses (vs. unknown weaknesses), and can produce
repeaetable sequences. They can also be run on different platforms
with the same results, without special hardware.  Good references?
The omnipresent Knuth, of course, but also "Numerical Recipes" from
Press, et al.

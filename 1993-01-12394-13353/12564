So I guess now we'll just say "oops" and note that the cat is out of
the bag.  According to information here the RIPEM code is in the
public domain so now that the accident has happened there's no problem
with further distributing it.

The questions only remain whether there will be men with dark glasses
and machine guns to say "Hi" at the airport/border if Vesselin ever
decides to visit USA, and whether the country of Vesselin's residence
will face the same fate as Panama.

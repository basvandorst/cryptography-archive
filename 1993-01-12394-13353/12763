 Your political geographic education has been different to mine.
        1st world = 'Free' and developed nations, mainly of N.America and 
        Western Europe . 
        2nd world = 'Communist Bloc' countries.
        3rd world = 'Non=aligned' (and mainly developing) nations.

 However, since the recent disappearance of the communist bloc, your 
 categorization may be more current. 
 
For the rest of your post, I think Steve Bellovin and Chris Browne have  
disposed of the matter sufficiently.

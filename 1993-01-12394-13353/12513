This discussion is silly in any case - it didn't matter whether
Noriega was an U.S. citizen, it doesn't matter if the people in
Somalia are U.S. citizens, it won't matter if the people in
Bosnia-whatever are U.S. citizens, it didn't matter that Shamir was an
Israeli citizen living in Israel when the patent secrecy order was
issued on him (on second thoughts, I guess it did matter in this case
since he isn't in jail now).  Also, just saw on the news today George
Bush saying that USA is the only superpower with the obligation to
take care of all the world's problems, by military force if necessary
of course.  The military were shown as the background of him, so I
guess I'll better go escape to Russia when they come and invade the
Helsinki area because of nic.funet.fi distributing munitions the US
government might not like.

Does the person you're impersonating read Byte Magazine?  No?  Try this:

Dear Editor:

	Enclosed is $nn for a small ad containing the public key for
	the Foo Corporation.  I realize that you don't have a section
	for such things; until you do, please run this ad in the
	``Classified'' section.

		Sincerely yours,

		Robin Hood
		Manager, Security and Cryptography Division
		Foo Corporation
		Sherwood Forest

If the editor doesn't know that Foo Corporation really has its offices
in Nottingham, the scam is likely to go undetected.  Remember that you
don't have to operate on messages that innocent dupes send you; you can
pass them on to the real office.

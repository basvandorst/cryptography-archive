I've been a bit out of touch with crypto research for the past
year, and I was wondering if anyone knows the current status of
the LOKI (1991 version) block cipher. In particular, has it been
broken since it was re-designed 18 months ago?

I didn't make it to AUSCRYPT'92, but I heard that there were
a few papers involving cryptanalysis of LOKI. Can anyone give
me a (very brief) summary of what those papers achieved?

For those of you not familiar with LOKI, it is a 64-bit block
cipher similar in structure to DES, but with a 64-bit rather
than 56-bit key. It was originally developed by Lawrie Brown
at the University of NSW in 1989, then broken and re-designed
by me in 1991. Although I'm no longer involved in the design of
cryptosystems, I'm really curious to see whether my changes have
survived the test of time ;-)

By the way, is the creation of sci.crypt.research going ahead?
It would have my vote at least.

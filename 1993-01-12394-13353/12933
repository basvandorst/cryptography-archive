No he's not.  He didn't make the post here and perhaps does not even
know it was translated and posted in semi-english.

What we have here is the words of someone apparently of strong credential 
being presented for consideration.  Somewhat like someone poking around
and finding out that Einstein wrote in some obscure journal that
energy and matter were related by the speed of light.  You can 
attack the assertion because your don't like it or because you
don't like the messenger but if you're intelligent, you'll consider
what he said.

This gentleman's words have been offered for your consideration.
You may ignore or consider them as you see fit.  He owes you nothing.

I would have really loved to have understood the TeXed analysis of
one of his assertions but since I have no use TeX, having graduated
to whizzywig typesetting, I guess I'll have to remain in the dark.
A word explanation would have been most useful.

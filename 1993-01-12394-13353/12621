Your views are clearly in the minority -- at least in this group.  Not
only that, I think everyone is sick and tired of hearing them over and
over like a broken record.

It's a common propoganda technique to try to squelch those with whom
one disagrees by claiming that their attacks on you are common propoganda.

You're the one with the extreme political views -- at least in relation
to the readership of this group.  And you're generating an awful lot of
hostility by asserting the validity of your own views over those of
others.  You are so effective at doing this that you have almost single-
handedly managed to lower the signal-to-noise ratio here to the point
that a lot of people are unsubscribing.

In the last 20 days, David Sternlight has managed to post 71 articles
to sci.crypt.  That's more than 3 1/2 per day.  It wasn't long ago when
sci.crypt only contained about 3-4 messages per day.  In comparison,
Perry Metzger and Arthur Rubin have posted 10 and 25 messages in the
last 20 days respectively.  I doubt I could find another poster to
sci.crypt that has posted even half as many articles as David Sternlight
has in the past 20 days.  And I doubt I could find more than a couple of
instances of an article posted by David Sternlight in the past 20 days
that contains anything other than political and ethical ramblings which
I assert the vast majority of the readers of this group would prefer not
to read.

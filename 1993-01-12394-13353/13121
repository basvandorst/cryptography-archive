Well said! 

Most posters on this PGP/PEM/RSA/legality/ethics thread have not
separated their personal wishes from what the law, rightly or wrongly,
says.

Me, I'm of two minds as well.

On the one hand, I have a copy of MailSafe, from RSA Data Security,
and recently attended the RSA crypto gathering in Redwood Shores. I
have great respect for their total effort and don't consider them to
be shills for the national security state. I have a strong feeling
that their tools are more robust than those in PGP (hardly a surprise).

On the other hand, I doubt the moral and practical validity of most
intellectual property patents. Good ideas in architecture, in novels,
and in most other areas, are not protected per se...copying the
precise implementation may be an offense, civil or criminal, but not
being influenced by the ideas.

But what I want and what the laws wants are usually two different
things.

With respect to the patent issue, you are correct.  However, the ITARs still
may pose a problem.  I honestly tried to read the damn things, but without
being as well trained in the obfuscation of language as the lawmakers who
concocted them, I got lost and punted.  Until it is clear to me that the IDEA
code in PGP doesn't need a license (I understand there's no patent problem,
here, either), and that the "re-importation" of PGP after (substantial?)
foreign work isn't a violation either, then I'm willing to sit back and wait
until some kind of resolution is reached.

In the meantime I'm going to use RIPEM, which I have gotten working nicely
with my mailer.  There's no patent or ITAR issues to worry about, and it's
nearly PEM compliant.

Other government employees may (will?) make a different decision that I have.
No problem!  I just don't want to lead with my chin on this one.

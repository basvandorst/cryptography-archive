I thought of clear-signing the post with PGP, but then decided against it
since it would have involved shipping the entire thing home to sign (I won't
use PGP on a multiuser system) and back again, and would have almost
certainly screwed up the automatic unsharing process.  Unfortunately until
there's some organised way of authenticating postings (eg PEM or the
equivalent functionality in PGP) there isn't any easy way to authenticate
the posting.

(On the other hand I doubt very much whether the NZ govt could be bothered
messing around with usenet postings, and if there were discrepancies
caused by mainpulation on non-NZ sites it would probably be discovered
pretty quickly when differing versions of the code were found floating
around).

Peter.

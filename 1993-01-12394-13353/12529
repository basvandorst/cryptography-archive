I trust that readers of this group have no trouble figuring out why
this would happen -- right?

The VCR+ people provide programs to the LA Times, and to TV Guide,
that are not identical.  Sure the codes work the same from both versions
of the program, but the difference in what is printed in the guide 
makes it possible for the VCR+ people to figure out _which_ copy
of the program was used to create a given set of plus codes.
That way if, say, LA Times started selling codes to TV Guide, or to
someone else, the VCR+ people would be able to blame the LA Times.
We intellectual property lawyers call that a "spike".

I understand clearly the advantage/need to encrypt before uploading,
but 1) most users to this network won't d/l the s/w and spend so
much time encrypting (currently incompatible with all off-line mail
readers)...

2) The BBS/network will likely be more vulnerable to shut-down by
feds than the post office is...  ie. sending local/abroad drug
trafficing via public access bbs/network would be an easy and
expected abuse.  In this case, the sysop sets himself up for
owning and transmitting illegal material - although he doesn't
know that, he should...  shouldn't he?

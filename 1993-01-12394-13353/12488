Bob Cain suggests the possibility of a spoofer interfering with a
plaintext voice call. Sure, this is certainly possible in theory,
although I wouldn't want the job of doing it in real time between a
pair of speakers who know each other very well.

Nevertheless, this is just one example of the general concept. With
public key cryptography you eliminate the need for confidentiality of
the initial key-setting path, even if you still do need to maintain
authenticity. And that is an enormous practical advantage, because I can
think of *many* non-confidential channels where I can maintain a
pretty high level of integrity in the traffic not being modified.
And I can use several such channels for redundancy.

Amanda Walker writes that the assumption that the U.S. has natural superiority
in cryptography is unwarranted.

My impression is that the key modern breakthroughs are in public
key crypto systems, including RSA, and that those were invented
mostly by Americans (not sure if Shamir is Israeli or American).
My impression is that the non-U.S. developments are essentially
derivative, elaboration, etc.

This is not an argument but a request for information. Am I mistaken?

And yet another book on Bletchley Park and the Enigma is Kahn's 1991
book "Seizing the Enigma" subtitled "The Race to Break the German
U-Boat Codes, 1939-1943".

As the subtitle implies, this is primarily about the German Navy's use
of the Enigma, which was a much tougher nut to crack than the simpler
Enigma used by the Luftwaffe.

If you haven't seen an Enigma machine in the flesh, I recommend it.
It really drives home the impact that the computer subsequently had on
the entire field of cryptography.

Among other places, you can find an Enigma in the British Science
Museum in London and the Smithsonian Museum of American History in
Washington (formerly the Museum of History and Technology).  I first
saw the one in the British Science Museum. As I stood staring at it,
lost in thought about how the subtle properties of that modest little
box changed the course of human history, an English woman and her
young son came up and also looked at it. "What's that, mommy?" "Our
soldiers used that in the war to keep the Germans from reading our
messages." Argh.

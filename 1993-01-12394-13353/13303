That is a forgotten factor which is a big chunk of the 1000x improvement.
Your 1993 chip will run a _lot_ faster than the 1976 version, as will
the associated hardware.

Just look at the clock speeds for IBM PC-type computers.  An original
PC had a clock speed of 4.77 MHz (as I recall); a 1993 PC has a clock
speed of at least 33 MHz (to say nothing of a data channel 4 times
wider -- an improvement of nearly 28x.  Toss in better performance
(a single op-code which took 6 clock cycles for a 8086 may only 
require 2 clock cycles for a '486) and you're taking about _serious_
improvements without even considering the expanded instruction set.

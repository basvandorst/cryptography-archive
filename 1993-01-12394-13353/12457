OK, I may be wrong (how is "imported" defined _this_ time), but it's
irrelevant to importing of PGP, or, in fact, PGP messages.  A PGP-encrypted
message probably is argueably "made by a process patented in the United
States", but PGP source/object code is not.  PGP code is not "an
implementation of a patented process".

In regard PGP messages, even if "imported ... product" applies to
information, the "importer" of E-mail is probably the first US site
receiving it, rather than the addressee.  The "importer" of encrypted news
would be all of the first US sites receiving it????

Also, this code section seems to make individual infringement for PGP
messages impossible to remedy, as the importer MUST be the one gone after.

Folks,

I'd like to announce the availability (ftpability?) of some papers/reports 
having to do with KryptoKnight Authentication & Key Distribution Service.
KryptoKnight is, essentially, a general-purpose network security package
developed at IBM Research.

The ftp site is jerico.usc.edu. The directory is pub/gene/kk. 

1) This paper describes the derivation of a secure two-party 
authentication protocol. (To appear in JSAC Special Issue on 
Secure Communications.)

2PP.ps      - postscript
2PP.ps.Z    - compressed postscript
2PP.ascii   - ASCII version
2PP.ascii.Z - compressed ASCII 

2) This paper describes the design of a family of three-party authentication
and key distribution protocols underlying KryptoKnight. (In submission to
ACM/IEEE ToN.)

3PP.ps      - postscript 
3PP.ps.Z    - compressed postscript 
3PP.ascii   - plain ASCII
3PP.ascii.Z - compressed ASCII


3) KryptoKnight overview paper (presented at ESORICS'92 in Toulouse.)
KK.ps       - postscript
KK.ps.Z     - same compressed


Cheers,
Gene

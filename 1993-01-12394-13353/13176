Because the customary definition of prime number says "a natural
number > 1 such that ...".  Hence it's a social convention only.  Like
most conventions in mathematics it's there for a good reason though:
Without it, you would not have unique factorization of integers into
prime factors, for example, because you could include any power of 1.

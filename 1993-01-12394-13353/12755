This issue -- just what constitutes ``technical data'' -- comes up
repeatedly on sci.crypt.  A year or two ago, someone (John Gilmore?)
posted an analysis by some DEC attorneys, explaining why they didn't
think the liberal position espoused here would fly.  Did anyone save
a copy?  I suspect I did, but it's not in any of the files I'd expect
to find it in.  Can someone repost it?  I did find a note indicating
that (not surprisingly) the State Dept sees it DEC's way, i.e., that
one can't just post cryptographic software.

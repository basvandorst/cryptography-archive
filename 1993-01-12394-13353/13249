Congratulations to Simon McAuliffe for a wonderful worked example of how one
can, if one is willing to be considerate of all readers, post a message
containing both mathematical formulas and graphical materials readable to
"ordinary" mortals without the need for special jargon such as TeX.

May his efforts be rewarded.

David

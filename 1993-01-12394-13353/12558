Unfortunately, this is not correct.  The majority of codes
for both the LA Times and the TV Guide are identical.  The
major class of programs where differences occur is with 
movies.  The LA Times produces codes from the beginning of
the movie until the start of the next listed program, while
TV Guide produces codes for the exact running time of the
movie.

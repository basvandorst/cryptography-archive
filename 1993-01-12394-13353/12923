   Is there any interest in a public  site for PGP public keys? If so,
   as a distribution site for PGP I  would be happy to work at setting
   one up. We  would not guarantee authenticity but  merely serve as a
   depository. Allowing  for a site  where one could  either verify by
   comparisom someones key (provided it was  on file) or get a list of
   keys in order to build a key ring.

   Please let me know  if there is any interest in this.  If so I will
   work at setting something up that  would be available under the PGP
   User account.

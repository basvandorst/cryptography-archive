Hmm.  Yes, my immediate reaction was that a spoof-proof protocol is
impossible, but it's not as easy to prove as I thought it was.  If we
have *no* information about each other then we have no reason to send
each other messages, so it's clear that we must have information about
each other but no cryptographic information.  I feel certain that if
anyone can describe the problem precisely it will be no problem to prove
it impossible.

Direct search. An upper bound on the number of exponentiations is
log_2(N). Each one takes O(log^3 N), so direct search takes only
O(log^4 N) operations. 

I.E.

Compute M = log_2(N). One then need only check whether it is a perfect
square, cube, 4th power.....  M'th power. Each of these tests is trivial.

Agreed.  Also, the laws of Finland and the US are basically similar,
the odds are that a crime here is a crime in Finland and I can be tried
there for it.

It is also in the realm of possibility that a meteorite will crash
through my house right now, but it is rather unlikely.  I also doubt
very greatly that I would be expelled for a civil case.   However, one of 
my four questions was that if I have PGP imported from Europe, can I use it
legally in my house here?  (Which evidently is extraterritorial, thanks
David!)  If my persona, my belongings, and my communications are inviolable
according to international law, it would seem so.

If I was under cover I would not post about it on the net.  Besides,
to my knowledge the Finnish Government has not employed spies since
World War II.

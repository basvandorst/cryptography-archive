I have a Tropez 900DX corless phone which uses some form of digital
voice transmission.  From reading the manual I see that the digital
stream is supposed to be encrypted as well.  Does anyone know how this
phone does it's thing?  Supposedly it uses one of 64K keys which it
randomly selects each time it is being charged.

I've used a frequency counter to determine the transmit frequencies and
listened to them with a scanner.  The transmission surely isn't analog,
it hardly breaks squelch on my scanner.  The voice quality sure can't be
beat so the security is secondary to me.  I am just curious how much it
would take to over come.

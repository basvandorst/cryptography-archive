This is a simple example of the anti-American screed. The Japanese
were citizens, putting them in camps was wrong, the Government has
apologized and paid reparations.

That's a lot more than many self-righteous critics of America have

This side bit of anti-American prejudice doesn't belong in this
newsgroup. Followups to talk.politics.antiamerican.

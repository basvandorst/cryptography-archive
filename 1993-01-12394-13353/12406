I just remembered something which I read in (I think) "Computer" from about
6 or 7 years ago, only I can't remember the details and the question has been
annoying me for years, whenever I think about it.

There was an article about finding the prime factors of fairly large numbers
(I believe on the order of 600 digits) of the form N=pq where p and q are
primes.  The article went on to say that somewhere some folks had a machine
and software that could get said prime factors in precisely *3* machine
cycles.  What I cannot remember was what this systems type was.  I seem to
remember it being something called a "systolic" system, but I am not sure.
I have forgotten the basic ideas behind these, so now I am doubly confused.

Any of you folks know anything about such systolic systems (if indeed these
are the one's I am thinking of) and how they go about sifting large primes
in so short a time?  

Thanks,

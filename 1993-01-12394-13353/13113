Well, while I agree with most of David's interpretation of current law and 
regulations regarding cryptographic technology, I can't say I agree with his 
arguments about the "ethics" of the situation.  To me, legality and 
ethicality are not necessarily correlated.  Many laws are not ethical, and 
many inethical actions are quite legal.

My general position is that legislative and regulatory restrictions on 
cryptographic technology (or in fact *any* technology) are inethical, as are 
software and process patents.  Right now, however, I choose not to summarily 
violate them, if only for pragmatic reasons.  On the other hand, there might 
well be situations in which some other issue would override my pragmatic 
concerns, and I would without hesitation engage in civil disobedience as a 
result.

I probably would not, however, broadcast this fact to Usenet :)...

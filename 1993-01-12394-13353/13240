This is probably a very stupid algorithm, but..:

isprimeroot(x) ::=

if(x prime) return TRUE;
for all n >= 2, n prime:
   y = x ^ (1/n)
   if (y integer) { if (y prime) return TRUE, else return FALSE }
   if (y < 2) return FALSE.

How to calculate n'th roots is left as an exercise to the reader.

Warning: The above is off the top of my head, so it may or may not be correct.

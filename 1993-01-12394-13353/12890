	Well, as usual you are mistaken.  Tex is very popular on unix
	boxes but there is nothing intrinsically "unix" about it.

	Here is where you clearly show that you don't know what you
	are talking about.  Computer languages are for communicating
	or representing algorithms.  Formulas can represent mathematical
	expressions which no unique algorithm can capture (e.g. how
	would you represent a differential equation in fortran?).

	Okay.  We won't.  We'll tell you instead. ;-)
	Surely you don't think you are fooling anyonen NOW do you?!?


>A little fairness and balance in this discussion would go a long way.
	A little truth too Mr. Sternlight.

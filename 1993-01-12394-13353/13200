Vasselin Bontchev recently asked if DNS mechanisms could be used to
distribute public keys.

Would it not be equally acceptable to put your public key in a .plan
file so that it would be listed by the finger program.  If you need a
public key from an individual who's machine you know, finger 
individual@machine would deliver it to you.

This seems to work locally (my own tests).  For example try
finger patlak@salus.med.uvm.edu  [not much security in this example since
this particular key is signed only by myself, but still...]

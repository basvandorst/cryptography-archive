As far as I know, US laws forbid the export of cryptographic
software. However, WordPerfect contains a (very simple and insecure)
cryptographic feature. And WordPerfect is exported from the US with
this feature. Why is this legal? Is it because the code is so
easily broken? Is this the very reason for making the code so
incredibly simple?

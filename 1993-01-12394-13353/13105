Could you send a list of all sixteen weak and semi-weak keys?  I would
appreciate this.  Don't post it as it's probably old news to most readers.

Your comments are well taken, but I wasn't intending to use it for
authentication.  I was implementing it as an option in a system that
would also provide CRC-32, MD4 and MD5.  I imagine DES in CBC is going
to be the slowest, and provide error detection somewhere in between CRC
and MDx.  By the way, what is the status of Snefru?  I understand that
in it's 128 bit 2 pass mode it has been broken, or partly so.
What about the 256 bit 4 pass mode?  And was there ever a version
beyond 2.2?

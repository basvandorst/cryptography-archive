The book you are looking for is:

	Gordon Welchman, `The Hut Six Story', McGraw-Hill, 1982

Welchman was one of the men who actually broke the Enigma, and he had a 
senior role at GCHQ for years after the war.

I would strongly recommend that anyone with a serious interest in 
cryptology should read his book.

In addition to telling how the Enigma was broken, it is the definitive 
source on the mechanics of production cryptanalysis - running a chain of 
intercept stations, designing and commissioning keysearch machines, 
translating, evaluating and distributing the product, and using 
disinformation to stop the enemy realising what's happening.

Assume such a chip could be clocked at 10 mhz. It would take 16 * 100 ns
to perform a single decryption. But since you have all 16 stages you
could pipeline the process so that you preformed one decryption every
100 ns. With 32 of these going at once you would average one DES operation
every 3.125 ns. One chip could cover the entire keyspace in 7.14 years.
A parallel machine of 1024 chips could do it in 2.5 days. We are probably
talking in the 50-100K$ range.

It's not 32 cents but it's not a real budget buster either.

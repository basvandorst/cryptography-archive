   Finally, there seem to be two sets of codes. One, of up to six digits,
   is for the standard start times (on the half-hour) and lengths (multiples
   of 30 minutes). A second, of more digits, seems to be for the exception
   cases. The first set has now been broken and a convenient pair of
   "c" routines is making its way around the world. The second has not
   yet been broken, as far as I can tell, but is mostly of interest only to
   make sure the recordings of cable movies with odd ending times are
   correctly stopped to avoid wasting tape.

Of much greater interest on this side of the pond.  In the UK, TV
programs very often start and finish on non-30 minute boundaries.  I,
for one, would like to see a complete solution.

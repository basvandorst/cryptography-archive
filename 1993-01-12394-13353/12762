When ARJ first came out, I sent mail to Rob mentioning the problems with
exporting pkzip and advising that he may want to look into the legalities
of his using encryption in exportable software.  In his response, he 
indicated that he was just using simple xoring (which he expected to be
easily broken).  The _ONLY_ reason for encryption was to keep a casual
user from accidently private data.  Stopping crackers who are trying to
break into archives was not the point behind adding encryption to arj.

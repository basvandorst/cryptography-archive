Someone asked about the book I am writing. Title is Digital Privacy, a 
self defense manual written for people who know how to turn a computer on 
if someone shows them where the power switch is. 
In addition to cryptography, it covers anti-theft products and measures 
one can use, van Eck transient radiation interception, and computer 
hacking. It will be printed in the next few weeks.
Someone suggested that I have "sold out to RSADS" because I have 
recommended MailSafe as the most user friendly program available for non 
programmers and engineers to use to secure their files. 
Not true. Like I said, this book is for the "average" user.
I have concluded that using RSA keys longer than 200 digits and triple 
encrypting the DES (360 bit keyspace?) are totally unnecessary for the 
average person and small business owner. I believe that MailSafe provides 
more than enough security.
Finally, thank you to all who have provided useful information. I am very 
grateful.

1.  Of course, publicly stating that RSA has been duly informed that foreign
nationals have access to the files does _nothing_ to force RSA's hand
in this matter, does it?  [Don't know if this is/was your intention, but (a) 
consider the position your post puts them in.  Now (b) ask yourself, "Are they 
now more or less likely to openly publish now that I've put them there?"]
Semi-paranoid fantasy:  Is DS an NSA cover/plant?

2.  Rational rejoinder:  On the hand, maybe RSA knew what they were doing 
when they put it up on an ftp server.  I find it hard to believe they are 
ignorant of the ramifications this action.   

3.  Really paranoid fantasy:  Hell, maybe NSA knows how to factor big primes 
now and gave RSA the go ahead in order to get lots of good candidate material.

(Hey, I'm not paranoid...can't be, I'm a psychologist!)

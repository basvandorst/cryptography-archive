Yes, compression software provides clues just the same as standard headers.
However, compression also reduces redundancy.

I believe that Shannon's Information Theory implies that a signal with no
redundancy is uncrackable.  So, if you merely randomize the order of the
compressed bytes, the difficulty of cracking it should be an exponential
order of the length of the message.  If you want to make sure, and for short
messages, add some random stuff.  Then the cracker has the problem of separating
the signal from the noise, ordering it, and then (the easy part) decompressing
it.

I keep wondering why this appraoch isn't intellectually respectable.  At minor
computational cost and selectable increase in comm costs, it appears that
you can have a vast increase in security, including resistance to cracking
traffic beginning with common headers, etc.

I guess I am a novice also, because I don't appear to understand either.

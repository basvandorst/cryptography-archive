RSA has corrected their (I think) unfortunate error, though several
have pointed out to me that MIT distributes KERBEROS, which contains
DES, in just the same way.

As to "unambiguously moral or arrogantly dogmatic" I confess to
the first. Moral relativism, in my view, is the source of much
of the mischief in the world. As for the corruption of the
educational system by the relativists earlier in this century,
words fail me.

But this newsgroup is not the place for that discussion. Replies to
dev.null.

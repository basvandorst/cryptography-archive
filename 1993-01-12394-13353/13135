What is the source for this number? Is it a random integer? Is it
an RSA number, constructed as the product of nearly equal primes?
If the latter it is out of current computational range.

If it is not an RSA number and you tell me why you want it factored
I will give it a try.

See David Bressoud's book on Factorization and Primality Testing.
This is the most up-to-date book. Note, however, that the number field
sieve is too new to be in the book.

Most of the *details* of algorithms are discussed in technical papers
in various journals.

If there is sufficient demand, I will compile and post a bibliography.

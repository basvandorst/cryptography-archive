What about the chip on the output end that decides if the output is a
valid decryption or just junk?  At that rate you can't feed it into a
general purpose computer can you?

Hmmm... makes me think that double-encryption (with another alg - I'd
guess double encryption with DES would be decodable in a single DES, or
no?) might be worthwhile if it forces the algorithm out of hardware
and back on to a CPU...

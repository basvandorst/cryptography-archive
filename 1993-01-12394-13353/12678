I wonder if anyone has thought of including the key of a 
message with the message, in such a way that the key of the 
message was on the surface indistinguishable from the 
message.  An example might be a copy of the federal 
register.  The Federal Register is a daily publication that 
details federal regulations.  It is about 1000 pages on  a 
good day.  Suppose the encryptor referenced 1000 or so 
regulatory citations in an article about, say car emissions in 
California.  In another part of the 1000 page federal 
register, the exact regulations were given.  In yet another 
part of the Federal register, a regulation meeting 
description was given, citing a few regulations to be 
discussed, and the reasons for discussing them.  A 
decrypting party would look at the three articles, and see 
that the meeting announcement  filtered  the 1000 
regulations in another part of the FR, and those could be 
applied through some standard algorithm to the article 
about emissions in California.  The point is, the entire 
message is contained in one package, and the key is 
extracted from the sending signal.  Has this been tried?

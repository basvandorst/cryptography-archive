Bit commitment is an easy protocol.  Alice commits to a bit (or a series
of bits) in such a way that Bob does not know what the bits are until Alice
tells him, and Alice cannot change her bits once she has commited to them.

What I am looking for is a real-world example of where this protocol would
be useful (besides magic tricks).  It can be a computer example, or it could
be a non-tech example.  Useful is good.  Interesting is better.  Humorous
is best.

Any suggestions?

Bruce

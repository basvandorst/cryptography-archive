I think what David does is a very good idea to use in other
connections as well.  I would agree with those who think that what
David has done has probably won more converts and advanced the cause
of "encryption for the masses" and PGP than most other related events.
A good PR campaign.

Maybe we could "hire a Sternlight" for some other good causes, also?
Perhaps ending the drug prohibition?  Ending the totalitarian
direction the U.S. government has been going into (well, David seems
to already be working on this a bit)?  Contributing money to public
charities?  Supporting networks such as the Usenet and Internet?

It's a bit questionable on the netiquette side, but if the name of the
Sternlight for each of the groups is placed in the FAQ for easy
killfiling, it wouldn't be that bad.

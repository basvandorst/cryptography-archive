They already print serial numbers, and not all possible numbers are used.

It already happens - banks return cash to regional processing centres where 
the notes are scanned before being sent back out into circulation. This way 
the Bank of England can track even used notes if they want to.

The purpose of such schemes is not to detect forgeries, but to provide 
information on money launderers and thus help in the war against drugs (or
so the official version goes: I suspect that if you withdrew 50,000 pounds 
in cash from a bank in Northern Ireland and then lived off this in a quiet
English suburb for two years, the security people would start to show an
interest).

In response to John Kreznar:

[personal material omitted]

"his nation's arbitrary interference into the peaceful activities of
unaffiliated third parties, such as non- nationals who would trade in
encryption software?"

The U.S. is sovereign in its own territory and may make whatever laws
it wishes with respect to the activities of non-nationals within our
borders, regardless of where the non-national is physically located.
Non-nationals who live outside the U.S. but have accounts in U.S.
banks inside the U.S. must, for example, obey our banking regulations.
Electronic transmission of materials from or to the U.S. is covered
under this notion.  Such things as PGP 1.0 finding its way out of the
country, or PGP 2.x finding its way in do cross our sovereign borders.
Those are simple facts of physics.

Thus non-nationals who would trade in encryption software may freely
do so outside the U.S. within their own laws, but when it comes to
importing or exporting anything, to quote the old aphorism about
smoking, "Your right to smoke ends where my nose begins."

No, the *government* "has" to say that... :->

Well... something exists, but the official name is more than likely no longer
"Aurora" (if it ever was).  But the rest of us have nothing better to call it.

One of the variants could be using PDWE propulsion...

Something up there has been shaking up southern cal.

Not quite.  The YF-12 was around for a while before the SR-71.  The YF-12
first flew in August, 1963, while the SR-71 didn't have it's first flight
until December 23, 1964.  Of course the A-12 beat them both by first flying
on April 26, 1962.  The SR-71 certainly was NOT created simply by "renaming"
the YF-12.  They are considerably different in several areas...

I guess this is pretty much exhausting the sci.crypt relevance,
BUT... the up/downlink from Keyhole satellites use the absolute
very best encryption that NSA can generate!  So I guess not all
of it was off topic...

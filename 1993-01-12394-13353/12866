Research has shown me so far that there is no point to point protocol
that eliminates a spoof, active intruder, attacker, whatever you call it.
The best I've found (with help from you all) is a protocol attributed
to Rivest and Shamir which is nifty but requires each end to share a
pair of passwords.

Well, it seems to me that if that is the best that can be done with a
"cold call" (and that ain't good enough) then one may just as well use
standard cryptographic techniques and transform those passwords to
standard keys.  I hope I am wrong.

All caveats about good, strong passwords or phrases apply.

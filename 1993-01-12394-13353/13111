Well, it is very unsecure, of course. I am not even root on our
machine and probably several people can tamper with the file of public
keys on our ftp site. But, since there is no real solution to
spoofing, a not good enough (from security viewpoint) distribution
site is better than no distribution site at all.

Read the documantation of RIPEM about the public key server - they
explicitely state that they do not guarantee ANYTHING about the
authenticity of the public keys on their server... Neither do I about
the public key collection on our ftp site. Use it on your own risk.
Besides, using a public-key encryption program on a multi-user system
is -very- insecure, but so what, I am running PGP on our Ultrix
machine... Even the scripts I am using to link PGP with my mailer
sometimes save the decrypted message as a file, so anybody with enough
privileges can read them...

BTW, somebody of the gurus here mentioned to me that it is possible to
use the DNS mechanism to distribute some additional information about
your machines. Maybe this could be use to distribute the public keys
of your local users... Would be nice if it is so - the DNS mechanism
works rather well... Could somebody with more knowledge on that
subject verify whether it can be achieved?

Regards,
Vesselin

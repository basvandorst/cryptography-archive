Great, so now I guess those users outside the USA who would like to
use RIPEM could try to rewrite the missing stuff... As a beginning, it
should be relatively easy to adapt one of the public domain DES
packages. And equivalent of RSAREF could probably be written using the
parts of PGP.

Ah, yes, indeed, this is a problem. Those header files actually
contain the interface to the RSAREF routines... Maybe RSA should be
asked to publish at least them freely? The interface alone does not do
any encryption, so there shouldn't be any problems exporting it...

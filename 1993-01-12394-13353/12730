At one time I calculated pi and e with several houndred thousand decimal digits,
and after taking interest in cryptology the question sprung to mind: Would it be
safe to use the binary expansion of an irrational number as a one time pad. To my
knowledge suche sequences of bits exhibits no knowns statistical patterns, and
provided the key is large enough >60 bits, the one time pad would be sufficently
hard to find.

If I where to use a 68000 processor for the implementation of this scheme two
difficulties arises:

1) Taking square roots is rather expensive, and this limits the size of the
message to be encrypted.

2) For effeciency reasons it is best to extract square roots limited to 32 bits
of length. (The greatest divisor fopr the DIVU command) This provides a rather
limited key space.

To give a remedy to point 2, would it be possible to extract the square roots of
two 32 bits numbers and subtract them to give a key length of 64 bits (addition
would only give 63 bits). Given that no more than one of the keys are a square
number (giving a 000000... bit sequence) would the bit sequens exhibit any known
weakness?

Any comments would be welcome.

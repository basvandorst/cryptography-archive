uri, sidelnikov never posted an article.  someone posted an article
that they claimed was a translation of a message authored by 
sidelnikov.

personally, i'm not giving much weight to sidelnikov's message, absent
more detailed explanation.  certainly it is interesting food for 
thought.  but little more than that.

Tell that to your local ham radio operator!  :-)


Fact is, you can start with nothing but cryptographic information about the
other person -- specifically a public key and maybe an e-mail address.

Everything else you learn about the person, you will learn care of digital
envelopes & signatures.  After a while, you have a relationship.

Spoof?

There's no spoof here -- unless you count the possibility that the person
with whom you're conversing is passing your messages along to someone else
for that person to answer for him/her.  Of course, if you correspond with a
corporate executive or major politician, you're likely to run into that
kind of spoof.....

Perhaps we should ask instead whether it is possible for a protocol to
establish that there is precisely one human privy to the communication on
each end.  If we can't trust the human on at least one end, I don't see
how to create such a protocol -- short of inventing a mind-to-mind link
which never sees light of day -- but even then, the recipient can be
passing information along to a third party.....

What do you want from a spoof-proof protocol?

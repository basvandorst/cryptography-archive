Well, how does it work?... What kind of microcontroller is on
the 'credit-card' which you can buy to receive D2MAC 
satelite TV.. Tech specs anyone ?  What information is
received from the satelite..? Or is it so, that the real
protection lies in that nobody knows anything about the
implementation of the encryption system...?
Could be fun if anybody had information about other hardware
protection types.
Don't get me wrong.. I'm a software-guy - wouldn't dream of
hardware reverse-engineering satelite coders. But I sure am
curious about the technology involved...

Just the usual mixture of lies, threats, and half-truths we've come to 
expect from Mr. Sternlight.

He'll stop at absolutely nothing to intimidate those who use PGP.
Of course, whose to say that ripem is any better.

It's all a hoax folks. Mr. Sternlight has never even been to the former
Soviet Union. I verified this by a check of the Visa records, which
(fortunately) are computerized. I suppose he might have
changed his name recently, but I doubt it.

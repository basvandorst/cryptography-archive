Grace Hopper retired from the U. S. Navy as a Rear Admiral.  The ceremony 
was held onboard USS Constitution in Boston.  I had the privilege of 
hearing Amazing Grace deliver a talk to my Reserve Engineering Duty 
Officer class.  One of the visitors in the audience was another legend, 
Admiral Hyman G. Rickover.  She made sure he got his nanosecond, just 
like the rest of us.

Is it really necessary to reverse-engineer the VCR+ algorithm?  I thought
that VCR+ is patented.  If you can obtain the patent number, then the patent
can be retrieved.  The patent _must_ disclose the method used.

Of course, you can't legally _use_ the patented technology without licensing
it, but it's perfectly legal to understand the technology.  That's the whole
point of the patent system -- to make information public.  

I guess the question is whether the patent number is public information...

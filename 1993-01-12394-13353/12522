Hello,
	Some time ago,  I said that RSADSI President lied to me
	about delivery of his revised RSAREF license. In fact,
	he was only late in keeping his word. The revised 
	license from him was received December 23, 1992.
	Thus I owe him an apology, and here it is. I
	shouldn't have been too hasty, accusing 
	Mr. Bidzos of lying.

	Another piece of news - I asked for, and was granted
	permission to access  those four routines in RSAREF,
	which provide direct access to RSA algorithm.   This
	probably is of common  interest/concern  (and speaks
	good of PKP).

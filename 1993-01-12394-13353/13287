My Uncle receives news feeds via CNBC over his local cable system.  He plugs hi
s cable line into a special box he purchasedfrom CNBC/FNN and from there it ent
ers his computer via the serial port.  He must run software which was supplied
to view the news arriving.   Now if he looks at the data coming through the por
t with a communications program, the data appears to be encrypted.   He would l
ike to be able to write his own software to select certain news files coming ac
ross and save them to disk.  But the encryption poses a problem.  Is anyone fam
ilar with this system?   If anyone is interested in seeing this raw data, I wil
l surely  mail you a bit.      Thanks   Greg  Buschman@vm1.nodak.edu

Have you tried it ? (pgp -c is not a very fair test, as there are
some tmpfiles which let me think that pgp tries compression&encryption:-) )
On a sun 3/60 IDEA encrypts 1MB of data in 13.43 seconds.
(78060 bytes per second) Perhaps you can compare this with you machine.
As far as I know the sun 3/60 runs rather slow ;-))
Or do a 'cc -DTEST idea.c -o idea' and then run 'idea' separately...
Friendly greetings,

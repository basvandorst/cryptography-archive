To get a copy of  NIST's special publication Public Key Cryptography
(NIST special publication 800-2) you have to buy it from the US 
government printing office. The best I can find is the usual 
boiler plate: superintendent of documents, US government printing office
washington, DC. 20402. I ordered my copy through an telephone order
line that they have. But I had a detailed flier number to do it with.
You might try to see if the clerk on the other end of the telephone
can help you out. Its in NISTS reports on comptuer security series
code number  NSPU2.

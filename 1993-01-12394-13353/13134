200 digits is not "truly huge" by current standards. In fact, they are
rather small. 200 digit numbers can be PROVED prime [not merely
verified as probable primes] in 10 minutes on a Sparc using
an improved version of the Cohen-Lenstra algorithm [improvement
due to Wieb Bosma].  The Atkin-Morain-Goldwasser elliptic  curve method
will take just a little bit longer.

I have discussed the best procedure for finding such primes on many
occasions in this newsgroup. It involves a version of the Brent
linear sieve, followed by ordinary (minus side) probable prime
and Lucas (plus side) probable prime tests on numbers that survive
the sieve.

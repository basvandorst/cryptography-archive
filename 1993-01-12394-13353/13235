    This is provided in response to an inquiry from Ralf Fessner
 (rf4@irz202.inf.tu-dresden.de) regarding algorithms for decoding Goppa
codes.

   Goppa codes can be decoded in a manner very similar to the decoding of
BCH codes.  In fact the procedure makes use of a form of Berlekamp's
iterative algorithm for finding the error-location polynomial for a BCH
code.  Two good papers are:

1.   N. J. Patterson, "The Algebraic Decoding of Goppa Codes," IEEE Trans.
on Inf. Thy., IT-21, pp 203-207, March 1975.

2.   Y. Sugiyama, et. al., "A Method for Solving Key Equations for Decoding
Goppa Codes," Information and Control, Vol 27, pp 87-89, January 1975.

   This Spring, I was able to have a discussion with a senior executive of 
VTECH, I asked him about the codecs & encryption.  It was a situation where
I had a 'need to know,' & if I recall correctly, he indicated that while the
Tropez was (vo)CODED over to digital, it was NOT encrypted!  This
contradicts information which comes with the Tropez 900s, but such things
don't surprise me any more, after the blatant lies Motorola made about their
speech-inverted 'Secure-Clear' line.
 
  Perhaps the VTECH marketing staff made the typical assumption that 'coded'
is synonomous with 'encrypted' or 'enciphered.'

   I can't see VTECH or any ofthe other developers of 900MHz codec'ed
cordless phones spending too much time on cryptographic protection for these
phones.  For the moment, it would be a lot simpler to intercept the Tropez
conversation via physical tapping, & physical tapping would also defeat any
crypto on the cordless phone RF circuit.   Only the idiots at Motorola's
Consumer Products Division have warranted that their cordless phone is
actually 'secure.'  That's pretty pathetic, since they use analog
voice-inversion when there are a variety of digital codec'ed,
direct-sequence spread-spectrum cordless phones out on the market!

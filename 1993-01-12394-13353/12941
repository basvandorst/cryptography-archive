The person who decrypted the passage, Jim Gillogly, discussed this very
issue with me via email, and has already mailed to the "Keeper of the FAQ"
that whole passages should probably NOT be presented as plaintext proof
of decryption.  I suggested that just one rather innocuous-looking sentence
ought to prove the code has been cracked.

The translation of the Italian text, in this case, appeared to be perhaps
a Unix talk session (or just a passage from a book - who knows). Anyway,
I can't see how it would be illegal for the codebreaker to present the full
text... once something is posted on the net it's fair game.  The person
who might possibly have broken the law would be the one who put it there
(the encrypted text) in the first place.

But in the interest of not being used for nefarious purposes, you are
absolutely right: we should not unwittingly post the *entire* plaintext of
a decryption challenge.

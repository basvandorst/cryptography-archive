It's more readable than any of the alternatives.

Seeing as how TeX is very much a standard in the mathematical world,
it's hardly an inappropriate use.

Is this intended to be an insult, or a compliment?

The message certainly provides more technical analysis than any of the
"politically motivated" messages that have been clogging Sci.crypt
lately.

I, for one, would be quite pleased if some of those "political"
messages left, and there were a lot MORE messages like Mr. Neuhaus'
message.

It looks to me like you're insulting Mr. Neuhaus because he posted an
article that was actually about cryptography, insted of being about
the politics of cryptography.

You're criticizing him for not using Sci.crypt.research, the
(currently nonexistent) newsgroup where the "nerds" that actually want
to do cryptanalysis post information on how cipher systems WORK,
instead of using Sci.crypt.political-arguments, where people argue
futilely about whether cipher systems are legal or not.

You can strip off the header information, and run the posting through
TeX, and get a {\it typeset} version of the posting.  If THAT isn't
clear enough, then the CONCEPTS are probably too technical to handle,
in which case it REALLY DOESN'T MATTER what kind of representation is
used.

Which "universal" representation were you proposing?
- Pascal?
- Algol?  (Algol has been treated in the international community as
the "standard" way of representing algorithms in refereed journals and
the like.)
- FORTRAN?
- C?
- Lisp?

I don't think you'd have been any happier if he had presented the
material in any of these forms either.

It would be appropriate to use one of these (probably the Algol
representation) if Mr. Neuhaus was actually trying to describe an
ALGORITHM.  However, he wasn't, and thus it is inappropriate to
describe the mathematics using an algorithmic representation.

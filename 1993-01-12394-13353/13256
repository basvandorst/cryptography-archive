Quoting from pgpdoc1.txt, Extracting a Key fro your Key Ring:

"If the key has any certifying signatures attached to it on your key
 ring, they are copied off along with the key."

Suppose A has certified B's public key and passed it on to C.
C wants to give that key to D without revealing any association
with A.

Ah. Thanks.

(Lines starting with a minus sign get "- " prepended.)

Hmmm... I think the (RI)PEM people have some thoughts and/or an actual
Internet draft someplace, -- whatever they can do, PGP can do also ;-) --
but I have been unable to locate the thing yet.

Most of the necessary code should already exist in the metamail distribution.
Time to reread those MIME RFCs I suppose.  ;-)

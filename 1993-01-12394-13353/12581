   You can copyright anything.  The question is whether it would
   hold up in court or not.  No copyright on just a number would hold up in
   court however.

   But you can Copyright a table of numbers and show times that you publish
   (which is what they do).  However, it's questionable if they could claim
   infringment if you copied some of those numbers and times and re-publilshed
   them.  I'm sure however, that Gemstar would take you to court if they could
   prove that you copied one of they copyrighted listings, and let the court
   decide. 

A similar case was decided in the UK about a year ago.  TV listing
used to be the perogative of the broadcasting companies, so there were
only two magazines: one by the BBC and the other by the independents
acting in concert.  Recently, it was held that this was monopolistic,
and so now anyone can publish listings.

Network World's Jan. 18th issue talks of two NSA developed public-key
encryption algorithms. One is called the Message Security Protocol (MSP)
the other (PMSP) Preliminary Message Security Protocol.

MSP is for classified data, PMSP is for "unclassified but sensitive"
data. Can anyone provide references for these encryption algorithms?

Thank you!

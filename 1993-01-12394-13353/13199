Well, no.  This has been rehashed extensively in comp.risks.  The unmanned
Mariner I flight to Venus on July 22, 1962 went off course and was destroyed.
The cause was a missing hyphen in the hand-written guidance equations,
causing a faulty implementation.  Coupled with a failure of the onboard
rate system hardware, the computer processed the tracking data incorrectly,
the rocket went off course and was destroyed by the range safety officer.
Look in the comp.risks archives for extensive, referenced discussion of
this.

The period-for-comma story has been circulating for years in relation to
this incident, but according to the discussion on comp.risks, the missing
hyphen was the real story.

Followups probably belong in alt.folklore.computers, or somewhere.

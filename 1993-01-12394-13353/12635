This is a bit off the subject, but the reason pictures of that quality
were published is that one of the "secrets" in this area is just how
high the resolution of reconnaisance satellites is. Every so often
we read an episodic speculation ("able to read a license plate in
a parking lot") in Aviation Week or elsewhere. By publishing the
pictures in as high quality as possible, The Times was answering
the question by implication, and cleverly enough that the Official
Secrets Act folks didn't twig that that's part of what they were doing.

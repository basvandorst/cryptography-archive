Isn't there a possibility to place some mirrors up there, align their 
positions by measuring distances between them with laser or whatsoever,
and then computationally combine the so won pictures ? Using something
like the Fresnell-Effect for lenses. I am just guessing, but I think
one could 'simulate' a bigger telescope (better resolution) by placing
some little telescopes at strategical points and combine the input. 
I thought I heard of something like this some time ago, but I can't 
remember well. So if anybody could clarify :-)

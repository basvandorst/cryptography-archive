The thing that keeps tickling at me is that we *do* have a piece of
information in a logical sense if we use Diffie-Hellman.  If there is
no spoof, we are using the same key.  If so we aren't.  There is
information here, just no obvious way of using it.  Given this fact I
think a proof is going to be real hard.

The goal here is simpler than all the considerations about who is on
the other end.  All caveats about what you say to a stranger are in
force.  All that is desired is that between any two connection points
local to two individuals there can be no others.  A modest start.

I have come up with ways in real time, point to point to use this fact
that are kludgy but hardy.  In a packet switched environment I haven't
a clue.

Sorry to be talking so much crypto stuff.  It doesn't seem to interest
many. :-)

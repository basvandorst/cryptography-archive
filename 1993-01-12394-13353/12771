It seems it would be more feasable to take several pictures by the same 
satellite at slightly different locations and combine them 
electronically. I'm not sure I understand the limits of this but I've 
been led to beleive that it works. A similar method is being used with 
radio-telescopes, recording the information simultaneously at several 
sites and then combining the data to get better resolution.

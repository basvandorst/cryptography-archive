Agreed, no way at all to prevent this.

Let's simplify the problem.  Assume the existence of a box that can
accept commands and digitize voice coming into it and that performs
automatic digital protocol's going out of it.  The reduced question is,
"Is there a protocol that can unsure that there is not another pair of
boxes actively interposed between two others?" Easy to say and
understand I hope if not easy to state formally.

Peace,

My purpose in posting this is not to enter into the dispute between
Zimmermann and Sidelnikov, but to comment on some interesting questions that
the Sidelnikov post may raise. Some preface may be in order:

In my many individual visits to the Soviet Union at the personal
invitation of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, and in my discussions
with Soviet scientific leaders, it became clear to me that in the
Soviet structure, the academic and Academy scientific structure was
intimately bound up with the military and intelligence structure.
Through the mechanism of the State Committee on Science and Technology
the Soviets ran their Nuclear, Missile, and many other programs.
Leaders in the State Committee were also leaders in the Soviet Academy
of Sciences and in the academic community.

This raises the question of whether Sidelnikov had some senior role,
directly or indirectly, in the Soviet's equivalent of the NSA. If he
did, then his comments may be both authoritative with respect to
access to what once was highly classified technology in the USSR,
and (by the argument of parallelism) revelatory of the state of
technology at the NSA.

Is this lab a former part of the Soviet NSA? If so, one may assume
a very high level of expertise, which gives major weight to what
Sidelnikov says. We know that many intelligence specialists in
Russia are now under- or unemployed and looking for work in
the Western community. Thus it would not be surprising for Sidelnikov
to "go public" as it were.

Maybe Sidelnikov is trying to tell us something here that goes beyond
the theoretical.

Is Sidelnikov saying more than that the exponentiation isn't as fast
as possible? Is he, perhaps, saying something about cryptographic
weakness?

If Sidelnikov says real time, he means real time. I take this to mean
that the Russians, and the NSA can do the factorization and read RSA
traffic with 256 bit keys in real time. If NSA's technology is better
than the Russians, maybe they can read even longer key traffic so
quickly as to make no difference. It would be interesting to see a
calculation (Phil?) which, assuming 256 bit keys can be read in real
time (call it a difficulty factor of 1.0), presents the difficulty
factors for 512 and 1024 bit keys.

This attitude is a hiding behind "academic" practice in an area where
Sidelnikov has raised the most serious doubts about a number of
aspects of PGP as presently implemented. For him to be both an
Academician (the highest rank in Soviet Science, given to very few,
and after massive and extended demonstrations of competence) and a
Laboratory Manager means we ought to take his words with at least as
much seriousness (but without the associated "special pleading" doubts
some might have) as similar words from the head of the cryptanalysis
division (or whatever it is called) of the NSA.

Let me be perfectly clear here. Sidelnikov's standing in the
cryptology field in the Soviet scientific community is of the most
senior level, and that's not a statement about science politics. It's
also likely he was (is?) either one of the most senior scientists in the
former KGB cryptanalysis activity, or one of their most senior
advisors.

It's inappropriate to take his remarks as if they were those of some
competitive programmer picking nits about PGP's program code.  It's
especially inappropriate to take a confrontational attitude. I suggest
Phil rethink this. I also suggest that Sidelnikov's advice about the
use of PGP be heeded. Were I going to use it, I'd use no less than a
1024 bit key, and even then worry about some of the other weaknesses.

Finally, I'd suggest extreme politeness in responding to Sidelnikov,
and no little respect. Think of him as the Russian equivalent of
Einstein in his field if it will help. In Soviet Science, Academicians
are analogous to "the immortals".

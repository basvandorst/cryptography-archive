	I need a version of PGP for an Amiga and an IBM system.  
 I know, I know, the source is in alt.sources, but I don't have a *working*
compiler on both systems.  Could somebody **PLEASE** compress (lha, etc), 
uuencode and email it to me at my address below?  It would be MUCH
appreciated!
			
						Thanks.

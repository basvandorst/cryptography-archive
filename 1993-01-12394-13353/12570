The Commerce Dept's "Core List" (note: not the ITARs) exempts "fixed
band [analog] scrambling not exceeding 8 bands and in which the
transpositions change not more frequently than once every second",
"fixed band scrambling exceeding 8 bands and in which the
transpositions change not more frequently than once every ten seconds"
and "fixed frequency inversion in which the transpositions occur not
more frequently than once every second."

I think it's safe to assume that the NSA can easily crack anything
that fits within these limits.

I note that the very next paragraph controls items "designed or
modified to suppress the compromising emanations of
information-bearing signals", but then it notes: "does not control
equipment specially designed to suppress emanations for health or
safety reasons". You figure that one out.

In response to Castor Fu, who has gone to some trouble to id
Sidelnikov, as I've said in my e-mail to him (dunno if I've posted
this or not), I received e-mail from a Russian at one of the most
reputable U.S. Universities whose bona fides seem genuine, who says he
knows Sidelnikov, has met him in Moscow, and he is who he says he is.

Whether the Sidelnikov message is a spoof or not isn't known, but the
history of its posting (first to an internal Russian network, then
forwarded by a Latvian to us) seems to suggest Sidelnikov's bona fides
had ample opportunity to be questioned in Russia and Latvia, and
apparently were not.

Unless you think the Latvian poster made it all up.

Well, there's no point in arguing about it--the warning is there and
may be ignored, accepted, or used as a tip to attempt independent
verification of the claims.

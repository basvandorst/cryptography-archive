Well you are mistaken.
1. TeX runs not just on many Unix systems but also on the popular personal
computer platforms (MS-DOS, Mac) as well as other OS/Platform combinations.
Personally, I first used TeX on a system running MSDOS back in 1986.

2. TeX notation is commonly used in the academic world (at least among
mathematicians) for communication of mathematical formulae sufficiently 
complex to make other notations awkward.

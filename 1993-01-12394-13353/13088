People still work on them.  Many believe that they are a hoax, some do
not.  But even if the story is a hoax, the ciphers might still be real
and valid - even if they don't lead you to a stash of gold.  Some people
think the two unsolved ciphers are just random numbers.  I'm inclinded
to believe that they are real ciphers.

This is always possible - but unlikely in my view.

Most likely, there is no gold.  Either it was never there (i.e. a hoax), or
someone else found it years ago.  If the ciphers are cracked, and the
message reads: "congratulations on cracking the cipher - there is no gold!",
or something like that - then I'm sure we will all hear about it.  If
it does describe a location, then we won't hear about it until after they
have checked the location - but I suspect we would hear about it after they
descovered the empty pots of gold.

And if there is gold there, I think it's more likely that the person will
try to gain the legal right to own the gold instead of taking it and not
telling anyone about it.

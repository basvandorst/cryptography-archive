However, it is perfectly reasonable for us to get riled at David
Sternlight for posting a list of unsubstantiated assertions about PGP as
a means of spreading Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt.

I've resisted the temptation to follow up either of Sternlight's newer
posts on TeX; since he has still utterly failed to suggest an
alternative he is doing little more than waving his hands at the
keyboard, though he has presented plenty more rubbish that tempts me to
flames.  

In response to "Is there a single person here who agrees with David
Sternlight?" I received an email messsage that said "I sent mail
agreeing with SOME of what he has said."

So far, that's the nearest we've seen to support, though I don't know if
that means support on the more contentious things.

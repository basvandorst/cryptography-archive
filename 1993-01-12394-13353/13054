Why not a very simple true quantum uncertainty measurement?  A little
readioactive source, a counter, an interface to your PC, and the right
algorithm (look out, there are lots of possible traps).  An easy one
(thanks to John Walker and/or John Nagle for this, I forget):

Measure the time between successive particles detected by the counter.
Remember it.  Measure the time between the next two.  If it's less than
the first, generate 0; if more, generate 1; if the same, within your
means of measurement, drop it and try again.  Repeat as necessary.

If the half-life of your source is long enough (exercise for the
reader), the bias towards 1-bits will not be measurable.

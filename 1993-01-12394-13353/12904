In response to Erik Oliver, who, in response to:

>I should remind everyone that Sidelnikov did not present his work in
>a paper for review or even make the post in question.  His post
>was translated by a third person and forwarded here as a point of 
>interest.  

states:

"Yes, but he is asking us to accept his statements as fact, he needs to
back them up.  PERIOD. Referreed journal or not."

Read the > material again, Erik. Sidelnikov is not "asking us" to do
anything. His message was a passing comment on a Russian network,
forwarded by someone in the Baltics to the Net. We don't even know
whether the broken English is due to Sidelnikov or to a translation by
the forwarder of a crystal-clear post in Russian.

I take the time to post this because it illustrates what I consider to
be the bad attitude of several here, which amounts to a chip on the
shoulder. Just look at the language:

"asking us" "PERIOD" etc. One can see this bad attitude in the
messsages of several here.

I've read a remark by someone or other that the playground bullies
have moved to the Internet, and it seems to me there's some evidence
in support of that belief in these discussions.

Here is the law which covers imports as well as exports of crypto materials
to and from the U.S.:
123.2 Imports.

No defense article may be imported into the United States unless (a)
it was previously exported temporarily under a license issued by the
Office of Munitions Control; or (b) it constitutes a temporary
import/intransit shipment licensed under Section 123.3; or (c) its
import is authorized by the Department of the Treasury (see 27 CFR
parts 47, 178, and 179).

Further, Part 127 - Violations and Penalties - states in 127.1 (a):

(a) It is unlawful
    (1) to export or to attempt to export from the United States
        any defense article or technical data or to furnish any
        defense service for which a license or written approval
        is required by this subchapter without first obtaining 
        the required license or written approval from the Office
        of Munitions Control;
    (2) to import or attempt to import any defense article whenever
        a license is required by this subchapter without first
        obtaining the required license or written approval from
        the Office of Munitions Control;


125.2 Exports of unclassified technical data.

Paragraph (c) reads:

(c) Disclosures. Unless otherwise expressly exempted in this
subchapter, a license is required for the oral, visual, or documentary
disclosure of technical data to foreign nationals in connection with
visits by U.S. persons to foreign countries, visits by foreign persons
to the United States, or otherwise.  A license is required regardless
of the manner in which the technical data is transmitted (e.g., in
person, by telephone, correspondence, electronic means, telex, etc.).

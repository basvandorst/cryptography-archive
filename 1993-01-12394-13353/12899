Your degree is looking a bit rusty, David. Lots of economists use TeX
nowadays. For example, a post from an economist who is a TeX advocate:

   I have found the NeXT TeX and Mathematica environments on the NeXT to be
   very, very congenial.  I've written 4 books on this system, including
   one on Mathematica.

Also, Timothy Van Zandt of the Economics Department at Princeton is one
of the more proficient TeXers around. I'm sure there are many others.

Others have pointed out his mistake about TeX's relation to Unix, and
the folly of suggesting that an algorithmic description in Fortran of
the equations in Neuhaus' post would be more understandable than the
concise, unambiguous TeX format Neuhaus used.

Why should I post this to sci.crypt? Just look at what happened here.
strnlght makes an initial post flaming Neuhaus' attempt to inject
scientific content into sci.crypt. Instead of replying to the science,
strnlght attacks Neuhaus' choice of format, citing reasons which are
obviously flawed. Lots of people point out how wrong he is. Instead of
checking the facts and retracting his flame, he continues to spout the
same misinformed nonsense, only more stridently. strnlght is *certainly*
wrong in this thread. I believe his willingness, even eagerness, to make
pontifical statements on a subject about which he is obviously ignorant
certainly calls into question the value of his contributions to the
debates on cryptography and other subjects. If you didn't wonder about
him before, you should now.

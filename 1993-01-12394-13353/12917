Well, there has been a lot of RSA, PGP etc noise recently, so
I apologise in advance for adding to it.

I'll stipulate that.

I think you are overlooking the fact that there are, as with all
things, engineering tradeoffs here, and you have to decide what you
are prepared to pay.  Your statement is very black-and-white;
paraphrased (by me and I hope I'm not misrepresenting) "It is
possible, although inordinately expensive, to spoof any public key
protocol, therefore I'll use only private keys". My version of the
engineering tradeoff is that "Since I think it is unlikely that anyone
really wants to spend that much to spoof me, no matter how raunchy my
love letters are, I'm prepared to use public key techniques so I can
send them to people I've never met" :-).

Of course when I really care about knowing who I'm sending to, I'll
make sure I've met them in person and exchanged passwords. Then I just
have to hope that the password hasn't been tortured or drugged out of
them (which is probably less expensive than successfully spoofing me
from an intermediary position).

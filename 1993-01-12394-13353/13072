At the moment, I can't think how to define the problem precisely enough
to prove that spoofing is impossible.  Here's what I can prove: if Alice
and Bob want to talk, and I know everything Bob knows, and I can spoof
the channel, I can make it impossible for Alice to tell me from Bob.  I
let Bob's messages go through unscathed, but I put a message of my own
randomly before or after with all the non-cryptographic information the
same and all the cryptographic information from my sources rather than
his.  There is now no way for Alice to tell us apart; we are the same.

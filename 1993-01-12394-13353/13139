Why not consider ElGamal with a fixed large prime modulus p and
generator g.  (g need only generate a suitably large subgroup of the
multiplicative group of nonzero integers mod p, not necessarily the
entire group).

Suitable p and g may be found in a matter of minutes on a PC and shared
by all thousand sites.  With p around 512 bits, public keys can be
computed in about 0.5 seconds--just choose a random private key x, 1 < x
< p, and compute g^x.  Encryption/decryption/digital signature times are
not very much different from those for RSA (assuming random exponents),
if you do it right.  :-)

For details, see any recent cryptography text (Koblitz' A Course in
Number Theory and Cryptography, Springer is excellent), or FIPS PUB XX
(Federal Register, Aug.  30, 1992).  The latter is NIST's proposal for a
mandatory federal (ElGamal-based) digital signature standard; should be
official by the summer.  You might as well use the standard.

Hope that helps.

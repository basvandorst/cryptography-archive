  Could someone post or e-mail me the issue of Dr. Dobbs Journal that
had the article dealing with Luc and RSA. (I don't know what EXACTLY
the article was on, but that should give anyone who knows enough info 
to find the article)  The magazine at our library is in the request only
section, so you have to know the issue you want in advance... >sigh<
  Thanks!

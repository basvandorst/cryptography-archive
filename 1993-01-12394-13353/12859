	Since it takes a TV signal about a microsecond to travel 3m
	doesn't that mean that rather minor phase differences (based
	upon different distances to the TV Xmitter from the sender and
	receiver) would generate different random numbers and thus different
	freq sequences?

	As an example consider TV xmitter to be at (0,0), user A at
	(0,9) and user B to be at (12,0).  Since this is a 9,12,15
	right triangle that means that user A is 3 microsec. from the
	TV, B is 4 and they are 5 microseconds apart.  Thus is would seem
	that when the signal from B (at freq = freq_base + rand(4) ) arrives
	at A, A would be listening at freq = freq_base + rand(3 + 5).
	What is it that I am missing here?

The text of `Computer and Communications Security Reviews' volume 1, issue 1 
(December 1992) has been posted on ghost.dsi.unimi.it in directory /pub/crypt
as security_reviews.tar.Z. In case of difficulty, the server is mirrored by 
nic.funet.fi. We have almost run out of paper copies of this issue: hundreds 
of people wrote or emailed for samples.

Out of fairness to the publishing company, however, subsequent issues will
not be posted publicly (until a _considerable_ time after publication). 
Subscribers will however be able to get a machine readable version if they 
ask for it.

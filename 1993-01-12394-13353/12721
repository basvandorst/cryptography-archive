Even if this is the case, that would imply (in my layman's understanding)
that export of RIPEM would be legal, which would make it possible for those
both inside and outside the US and Canada to use it, and make it a
practical cross-border public-key encryption system.

(Of course, people may prefer PGP's keyring handling; Mark will probably
merge some of the more-requested features into RIPEM at some point.)

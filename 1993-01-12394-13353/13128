Based on some limited experience with narrowband voice crypto in the early 80's
(military only) you can easily get a one second delay on time/frequency domain 
encryption systems between units hooked up back-to-back.

The trick is to listen to the *encrypted* audio and try to re-assemble it 
into your original speech (in your head).  Rumor has it that they once allowed 
pilots to hear the encrypted speech to verify the system was in fact working.
After several flew into things while doing this they disabled the function.
It's *very* distracting when your own voice is munged in time/frequency/other
domains and you can hear it while speaking. No one who tried could even count 
to 10 while listening.

I suspect a similar delay in the AT$T system.

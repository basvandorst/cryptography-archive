You can't do forgery detection Unless there's something on each note
thats unique, and uncopyable and also in the scheme.

Without the hidden secret on the note, you can't stop people photocopying
valid ones, or else collecting the check values from a few thousand and
using them in the print run. Then all you get to do is detect a duplicate
instance of the valid number, and thats do-able from the serial number anyway.

Since my goal was to avoid printing hidden secrets, I don't think it flies.

oh well.

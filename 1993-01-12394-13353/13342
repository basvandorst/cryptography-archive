Only if their text is shorter than their headers.  Those types of postings
are generally discouraged any way, since they rarely contain any substance.

There are two ways to shorten the signature:
	1.) decrease the bit-width of the hash-function used on the message
	2.) (I think...) use a smaller (less bits) key-pair.

Both methods not only reduce the confidence which one can have in the
signature, but they also increase the risk of exposing your private key!

Don't do it.

Or we could all just use 50-bit keys, eh?

I've managed to put a copy of this book on hold at my local public library,
but I started to wonder if a computer text file of it exists somewhere on the
net? I'm really quite eager to read this now after hearing such high praise
for it.

Can anyone tell me where I might find a text file of this book, or better
yet, email me a copy? :) :)

Good grief, is that a copyright infringement? On second thought, let's not
debate that, not here at least. :)

Marc

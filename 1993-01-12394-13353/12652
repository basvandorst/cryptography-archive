	I just read today's USA Electronic Edition of "telecommunications",
that Motorola has announced four, new, "secure-clear" models of their phones.
	Does anyone have any information on these new models, in terms of
the "security-part" of the cordless phone?

	Also, it seems that security of voice transmissions by cordless
phones, will take a new jump down after reading today, on USA Electronic
Edition of "telecommunications", that AT&T will release for sale new
Cordless phones, priced around $499, that will send voice-transmissions
about a mile from its base unit.  Interesting that AT&T does not add
any security at all to it.

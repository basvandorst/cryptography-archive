I don't know about this specific model, but in general this
class of phone is much superior to the regular fm cordless
phone.  All you can hear is the digital hash when listening. 
These phones also usually do frequency hopping, but normally in
response to noise and not for security.

But be careful, many of these phones claim to be encrypted --
but close examination of the claim shows the manufacter believes
digitization is encryption.  (This Tropez might be different)

NB. In the US, it requires *no* court order to tap your cordless
phone.  If you want to broadcast in the clear, anyone who wants
to can listen.

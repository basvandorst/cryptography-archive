Helen Gaines's book ``Elementary cryptanalysis; a study of ciphers and
their solution'' has some tables for other languages, as I recall.  Note,
though, that there's no one table for any given language; you have to
have statistics based on the kind of traffic you're looking for.  To give
an obvious example, recent traffic in this newsgroup would show a weird
distribution of the digraphs ``pg'' and ``gp''.

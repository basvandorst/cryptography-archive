Marc Thibault asks how to activate the kill file for me in rn.

I think the way to do it most efficiently is to hit Control-K while in
a message thread in the newsgroup he wants. This will bring up his
editor and create a new kill file or open the existing one, and he can
add the line:

/From: strnlght@netcom.com/h:j
and then save that kill file.

What that will do is cause rn to search headers (h) for my
userid, and then junk (j) any messages it finds with that header.

If he wants to kill replies to me as well, he can omit the "From:"

He can also make a global kill file as above (see the rn
documentation), instead, which will kill messages from me in any
newsgroup, but it's inefficient since it causes rn to search every
newsgroup it enters for those strings.

I invite others who don't wish to read messages from me for whatever
reason to do the same. This will make their lives easier in that they
won't have to send me complaints via e-mail, which I cannot honor
since they are counterbalanced by the "keep up the good work"
messages.

You had to ask me first - it would save you to duplicate the effort...
:-) They are -extremely- easy to forge, even easier than ZIP's... :-(
The encryption is also -extremely- weak, -MUCH- wheaker than the one
in PKZIP...

BTW, when considering the archivers that provide "toy authentication",
I think that only PAK's authentication has not been broken yet, and
probably only because nobody has bothered to crack it... If you want
-real- authentication, use HPACK.

Vesselin

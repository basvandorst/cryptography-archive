Sorry, the information is not true. I just tried and the directory
/rsaref contains only the README file and a subdirectory called
'dist'. This directory is not readable for the anonymous user. I knew
what to look for, but got the message that the file is not a plain
file or something like that. Seems that it is still USA-only product.

Regards,

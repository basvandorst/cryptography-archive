How about something like this?

Use a magnetic polymer that "locks in" the ID and hash/encryption, but
can't be erased. I think it'd be difficult for a forger to get hold of
this material and the equipment to both record the polymer and "fix"
the magnetic domains. (The scanner to check could try to "erase" the
material first to see if the strip is "the genuine article".)

This polymer could be a "thread" (much like silver threads or strips
in currency) or could be a "stripe".

Should be possible. If marketed I want a "cut". :-)

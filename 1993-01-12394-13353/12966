I was dead wrong about this.  I spoke with David Maher, Chief Scientist,
Federal Systems, AT&T at the RSA conference today.  He is intimate with
every detail of the protocols used and it uses an internally enhanced
Diffie-Hellman (requires a license to find out and use the protocol for
interoperability, not good) with no other public keys at all.  He was
absolutely unequivocal in stating that there is no back door of any
kind in their 3600 "white-box" phone scrambler.  It sounds real good by
the way, is easy to use but introduces a rather curious one second to
two second delay in the voice.

Having said that, I wouldn't buy one for a nickle (much less $1200)
until they make the full protocols they use public.  I don't want a box
with a proprietary, undisclosed protocol no matter what the assurances
or sound quality.

I invite that full disclosure here for evaluation by experts.

   Well, it is very unsecure, of course. I am not even root on our
   machine and probably several people can tamper with the file of public
   keys on our ftp site. But, since there is no real solution to
   spoofing, a not good enough (from security viewpoint) distribution
   site is better than no distribution site at all.

Ah, but if you are putting *signed* keys (which are also known as
certificates) in your ftp site, and I trust one or more of the people
who signed your key, thus attesting to the authenticity of the binding
between your name and your public key, it doesn't matter where you get
the public key --- a ftp site is perfectly fine, since if someone tries
to tamper with the key, the signatures in the certificate will fail to
verify.  

The problem with RIPEM is not that you get your keys from a server, but
that it doesn't support certificates.  Without a certificate, then you
are relying on the integrity of the server to give you the true key for
 someone --- thus my earlier comment that this is basically "proof by IP
address".

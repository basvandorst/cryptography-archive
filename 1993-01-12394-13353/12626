Almost all factually incorrect messages I've seen here were posted by
David Sternlight. He also reserves himself the right to be the Only
Human Being Allowed To Decide Who Is Right (tm).

Since when does e-mail prove anything? (Unless it is PGP-signed, of
course... <grin>) Jokes aside, my guess is that:

1) David Sternlight has misunderstood/misinterpreted the messages sent
to him.

2) The messages sent to him do not contain correct information.

3) The "fact" that these messages support his oppinions is a fruit of
his imagination.

4) He is intentionally trying to fool us. If he reacts to this by
saying that I am implying that he is lying - yes, I do so. He already
lied us once when he promissed to keep off the discussion for some
time...

The only person here using propaganda, dogmatism, and spreading Fear,
Uncertanity and Doubt is Mr. Sternlight. Most of the others adhere to
the facts or at least to the common sense.

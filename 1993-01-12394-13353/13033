In an earlier post I wrote that an easy way to generate a
random permutation of the integers 1-n was:

There is a typo in this. The line 'z = random(n)' should
be 'z = random(i)' Then it is easy to see that, in fact, 
every permutation of 1-n appears with equal likelihood. It
is assumed here that random(n) returns a random integer
between 1 and n inclusive. Also,the loop might as well start
with i=2.

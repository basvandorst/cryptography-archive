In yet another cowardly post via an anonymous forwarding agency,
the writer claims to have checked the "computerized" visa
files.

Anyone who has cleared the border guard posts at Sheremetyevo Airport
has observed the primitive method they use to check visas by
sending them elsewhere via CCTV. Hardly "computerized." Anyone
who has actually seen the laboriously carbon-paper-typed visa
itself knows how primitive the system is there.

Even in the U.S. the visa files were computerized only relatively
recently.  Before that the immigration guys had to check your passport
in a book.

We have enought legitimate differences to discuss here without
being subjected to posts by jerks.

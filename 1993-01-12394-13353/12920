Upon replacing "American" and "Japanese" by corresponding nationalities
from the contemporaneous situation across the Atlantic, Sternlight's 
reasoning mutates into an apologia for the postwar Deutschland.
After all, they did pay up and say they were sorry... as Adenauer said, 
it was just a matter of "restoring our good name"!

Ditto for this gem.  Note also, that the German reparations 
were paid in full long before the Americans even considered
compensating the interned Japanese.  Moreover, no prominent 
US politician has ever performed an act of public contrition 
comparable to Willy Brandt's notorious genuflection.  Following 
Sternlight's theory of petrous projectiles, these facts would tend 
to assure the  Deutschland a rather higher position on the moral 
scale of nations, than that occupied by his own beloved country.

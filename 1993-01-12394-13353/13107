(sorry to clutter this band, folks, but I don't know a better way to
get through)

Rich,
        I tried to send you email with the unprotect source but
        Mailer-Daemon@troll1.msfc.nasa.gov denies your existence. It
        also denies the existence of troll1.msfc.. The denial was routed
        through troll1.cars and ford.msfc.nasa.gov.

        Drop me a line when the problem clears up and I'll send you
        the source.

        Cheers,
                Marc

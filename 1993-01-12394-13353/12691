Rob Stampfli suggests there may be a problem with unix systems'
granularity in measuring the intervals between random characters
typed as part of the PGP key generation process.

I notice that one RIPEM public key in the public server file has its
first 34 characters identical to my ripem public key. Perhaps this is
related. It seems an unlikely coincidence, given that the two keys
were generated by different individuals, apparently on different
computers, and very likely at different clock times.

It is much like the difference between exporting a journal that explains
how to make gunpowder*, and exporting gunpowder.   The government isn't
blocking the "knowledge" of how to make gunpowder from being exported,
only its implmentation.

Gunpowder wasn't invented in the U.S., and lots of people outside the U.S.
are quite good at making it.  Some would say even better than those in
the U.S.  [Continue to the point of absurdity.]

*Gunpowder is just an example, replace it with any widely known thing on the
munitions list.


Software, and computers has made this distinction very fuzzy.  With computers
the software is the implementation.  The computer is just a hunk of gold-plated
junk without the software.  But then again, so is a chemical plant, until
you type in the right formula.

Today I spoke with a representative of PKWARE about the
authenticity verification problems I reported yesterday,
but at the moment they appear to be quite busy with the
DPMI bugs and other troubles with the new release.  I
strongly suggested that they work with someone experienced
in cryptography when they try to fix the problem, but at
this point it remains unclear if the problem will be fixed
at all.

Just a few minutes ago I took a look at the encryption
feature in the new program, and noticed that three
changes have been made:

  -  The program now tries to crash debuggers, although
     this is trivial to defeat.

  -  The encryption header is now generated properly,
     using a loop that does addition/subtraction operations
     on the lowest few kilobytes of memory.  Although this
     random number generator is not cryptographically strong,
     optimized brute-force attacks (ala zipcrack) are no
     longer possible.

   - Instead of placing 2 bytes of the crc32 at the end of 
     the encryption header, there are now 11 pseudorandom 
     bytes followed by a single zero byte.  This change makes
     brute-force attacks impractical in archives containing 
     only one file.

In my opinion, the encryption algorithm is now properly implemented,
although its cryptographic strength remains unproven.

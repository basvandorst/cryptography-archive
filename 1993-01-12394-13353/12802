I was sent this from a broadcast to AT&T employees.

         *** AT&T today announced a high-power, all-digital cordless phone 
         with four times the range of today's conventional cordless 
         telephones.  The AT&T Extended Range Cordless Telephone 9530 
         operates in the 900-MHz frequency, providing virtually 
         interference-free conversations with consistent sound quality up 
         to one mile from the base.  The AT&T 9530 uses full digital 
         transmission to encode speech onto a radio signal, much like music 
         is encoded onto a CD, and to provide clearer sound over a longer 
         range than cordless phones operating in the 46/49-MHz frequency.  
         AT&T's spread-spectrum, frequency-hopping architecture, which is 
         patent-pending, actually avoids interference by "hopping" the 
         radio signal among 50 of the available 173 channels during a 
         conversation.  If any of the channels experience interference, the 
         9530 automatically swaps it for a new, clearer channel.  Because 
         it operates over a different frequency, the AT&T 9530 is 
         unaffected by forms of interference common to 46/49-MHz cordless 
         phones, such as garage door openers, baby monitors and radio 
         intercoms.  It also performs well in environments typically 
         difficult for conventional cordless, such as high-rise apartment 
         and multilevel buildings.  The random selection of 50 of 173 
         channels, along with digital speech encoding, makes it nearly 
         impossible to eavesdrop on conversations.  The AT&T 9530 was 
         designed and developed by AT&T Bell Laboratories, employing 
         advanced integrated circuit technology developed jointly with AT&T 
         Microelectronics.  The AT&T Extended Range Cordless Telephone 9530 
         will be available in late spring at AT&T Phone Centers nationwide 
         for $449.99.  For more information, call 800-222-3111.

         Well, I guess he could always run it through TeX and print it out
    or something. TeX is a well-known and widely-used typesetting program
    (Physical Review accepts articles in TeX format, for example, this
    program has penetrated the physics field so thoroughly.)

         As I said above, TeX is common. It is either in the public domain
    or available under the Gnu license (I forget which.) 

         In any case, your vote for "nerd message of the year" wasn't
    exactly constructive. Neuhaus expressed the mathematics in terms which
    most mathematicians and scientists are capable of rendering
    comprehensible. The tools are readily available.

 I don't speak for Fermilab, although my mouth is probably big enough...

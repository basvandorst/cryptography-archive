David...  I hate to respond to this in the public, and I hate to get
off the topic (PGP and cryptography), but I feel this must be said:

TeX is one of the most widely used in-line text formatters around!  It
is an easy way to format mathematical equations in a short number of
control-codes.  If you don't know it, I highly recommend learning it
rather than flaming about your own ignorance.

David -- just because *you* don't understand TeX doesn't mean that Dr.
Sudelnikov doesn't also.  The world does not revolve around David
Sternlight, no matter what you may like to think!

That having been said, I appologize to everyone else for having to
read this.

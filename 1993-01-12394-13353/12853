I am looking for a copy of:

	M. Blum, "Three applications of the oblivius transfer:  Part I: Coin
	flipping by telephone; Part II: How to exchange secrets; Part III:
	How to send certified electronic mail," Department of EECS, University
	of California, Berkeley, CA, 1981.

You'd be amazed how many people DON'T have a copy of this paper.

Does anyone have a copy of this?  Is anyone at UCB and can get a copy of this?

Bruce

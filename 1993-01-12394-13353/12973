I doubt that the sync algorithm scans looking for a channel.  I would
guess a sync sequence of some kind is transmitted when establishing a
"connection".  After this (possibly well-known) sequence is detected,
the handset and base may start using their own pseudo-random sequence
controlled by the selection of a seed while the handset and base are
in physical contact.  Keep in mind physical contact at some point is
probably required to allow a handset to access a base; with the increased
range of these phones over 49Mhz phones, the security issue becomes even
more sensitive.

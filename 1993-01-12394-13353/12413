Agreed.  So  far  as  I  can see, there's 2  different  items to
discuss. People who interesting  politics can call to  lawer  to
clear  the  water, I  believe.   Algo/program   legality   usage
discussion seems to  be too  incompetent  (IMO).  Sure,  there's
very  interesting and important questions, but  (IMO), sci.crypt
is wrong place to talk about. There's a lot of  other newsgroups
(misc.legal.computing for example) to do. Try this.

According to  name ("sci.crypt")  of the newsgroup, it's purpose
is  to discuss crypt science  problems. Not an US  laws.

I hope people will move towards correct newsgroups for  politics
discussions.  Another  decision  proposed by Bruce,  if somebody
think  that  it  is "sci.crypt"  the  very   place  to  politics
discussions. Well, let's leave  "sci.crypt" for  them and create
another newsgroup to descuss SCI CRYPT.

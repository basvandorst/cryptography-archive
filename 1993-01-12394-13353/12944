As much as I hate to disagree, you are wrong on this point.  I did not
want to refute, I wanted to repeat his results and was basically
reporting the difficulties I had just making out what his actual point
was.

This is not a flame at Sidelnikov.  This is also not a flame at you,
Erik (do I have to say that?).  I realized that what we had was not an
article for a refereed journal, and I tried to take what he wrote at
face value.  It's like somebody who says "The answer is 42" and you
have to reverse-engineer the question.  I picked the serial
correlation because it in seemed the most specific claim he made.  I
have no hope of discovering weaknesses in MD5, but I can compute a
serial correlation coefficient and compare real numbers.

I had not taken a look at PGP's random number generation routines
until then, so how could I refute any claims made about them?  They
could (and still can) come out to be true, after all.

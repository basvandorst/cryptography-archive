I would bet that this is because they want classified material to be 
safe for a hundred years or so.  They recognize that DES (while it may
be relatively safe for the near future) will be highly vulnerable to
brute-force attack within 50 years, and they have a lot of secrets
they'd rather no one found out about.   It doesn't have to be because
there are hidden flaws in DES.

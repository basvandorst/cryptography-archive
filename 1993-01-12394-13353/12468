Does it change the analysis if I substitute "month" for "day" above?
"If one can exhaustively break DES in a month, having to wait a little
over 5 years will defeat some opponents..."

I have to imagine that it would defeat nearly all the opponents, since
most of the data will be well-nigh worthless after 5 years.  Along the
same lines, even governments can't necessarily spend 64X to complete
a job which would otherwise require an expenditure of X.

In short, linear increases in complexity with sufficiently large
constant factors may provide a better security enhancement than do
exponential increases with small constant factors.

Not a flame, just a nit.

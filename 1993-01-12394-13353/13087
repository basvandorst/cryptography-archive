Threads which discuss the law and not the science of cryptography should
be redirected to misc.legal.computing. (The flood of such traffic in
sci.crypt is one of the reasons that misc.legal.computing was created.)

This is not correct.

ITAR does not distinguish between data inside a computer and data on paper.
*Anything* listed in the Munitions List is controlled by DTC in the State
Department. For example, the book Numerical Recipes includes a printout of
DES, which is covered by Munitions List category XIII(b)(1). By sending
Numerical Recipes outside the country without a State Department license,
the publishers are (in my opinion) committing a felony.

Now, we have something in this country called the ``First Amendment,''
which stops Congress from infringing upon the freedom of the press. I am
reasonably sure that if ITAR were challenged in court it would be found
unconstitutional. An NSA employee I talked to a few months ago grudgingly
admitted that the NSA could not control publications. You can imagine how
much of a fuss it would cause if the publishers of Numerical Recipes were
dragged into court.

Nevertheless, until ITAR is struck down, it is the law.

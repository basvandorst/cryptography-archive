	Oh NO! Beyond the reach of US laws?!  How horrible.  I thought
	nothing and nobody was beyond the reach of US laws! 
	Don't worry yourself David, the US government has shown quite
	emphatically that no one is beyond the reach of its laws,
	even people whose alleged crimes were committed on foreign
	soil.  (e.g. Humberto Alvarez Machain and Manual Noriega)

	Some of us see the "challenges" as opportunities for the 
	assertion of lost freedoms.

	I hope you are paying special attention Vesselin ;-) you are about 
	to get a very special and important lesson in The Planetary
	Law as decided by the democratically elected representatives
	of the OnlySuperPower(TM). ;-)

	If the World's OnlySuperPower (TM), democratically elected by the 
	citizens of the self same superpower want to abrogate the 
	sovereignty of any of the "lesser" states by extending
	its DemocraticallyLegislatedLaws (TM) across its borders it is not 
	only possible but democratic (by definition!) and therefore 
	an integral part of Truth-Justice-And-The-American-Way (TM).
	Only a foreigner would think otherwise. ;-)

	I guess Nixon had more flaws than I realized. ;-)

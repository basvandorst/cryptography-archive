Sorry, but I agree that the book is exportable, but the mag tape
would not be -- should be, but the Feds do NOT agree.  

I told this before, but...  A friend of my was publishing a public
domain Forth language system (books with full source code and disks).
He was told (perhaps six or eight years ago) that he could NOT ship
the disks to someone in the USSR wanting to buy them.  He could ship
the books.  This was despite:  The books and disks were available at
a variety of bookstores (Stacey's in Palo Alto for one) and was
public domain. 

This real-world experience completely contradicts your position
that it has something to do with being publicly available.  No,
it has to do with an antiquated view from the Feds that books are
ok, but once the code becomes machine readable it becomes a physical
item very different from a book -- and therefore controllable.

It seems to also be a question of: If you ask, they'll tell you NO,
so don't ask.  -- or --  Do it and wait to see if anyone throws you
in jail.  The problem is that if an officer of any corporation did
either of those, the directors and shareholders would likely go after
that officer for having done something VERY wrong.

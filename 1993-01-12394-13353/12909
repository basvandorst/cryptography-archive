Historically, this has been impractical because of the need to keep
the "expansion" factor down.  That is, input should be about equal to
output of the encryption step.

However, one could imaginably make exceptions in this day and age,
because the most vital information of a given organization could fit
handily on just about anyone's hardfile, as long as it could be and still
was expressed in text form or a "near text" form like a Word Perfect file.

But, I don't think it is practical for a communications channel of any
kind for the classical reasons and so would tend to solve only the "easy"
half of the problem.  One still must secure communications channels or else
people _talking_ about the document, via e-mail or ordinary telephone, will
tell the attacker enough anyway.  But, if one had full-motion video as the
channel, then hiding the data again becomes an interesting possibility.

Perhaps "digital concealment" ought to be a regular topic, here?

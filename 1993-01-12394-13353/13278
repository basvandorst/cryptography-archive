I would like to put together an article about Digital Cash -- the
concept, how it is implemented, how one can prevent forgery and
similar fraud and so on.  The audience is assumed to be intelligent
but not to have heard of digital cash before.

Can anyone help me with references please?  If the source documents
are available electronically, so much the better.

Either posting or email is fine.  If I get enough email responses, I
will summarize to the net.

I apologize in advance for repeating what is probably old 
information to many readers of this feed and for the crosspost, 
but I believe that the newer readers could use this information. I 
learned this from reading the soc.culture.soviet feeds, where the 
turkish wars are repeated daily. The FAQ was listed as "Avoiding 
the ... Flame wars" I wish I had a good reference, I checked our 
recent feeds and couldn't find it, but I thank the original poster. I am
saddened that this is necessary.

The latest flames from David on TEX have reached my threshold. He
is now in my KILL file for sci.crypt, alt.security.pgp and perhaps
other feeds.

To eliminate postings from anyone, if you use 'rn' you need to 
create a KILL file. The KILL file goes in a subdirectory
of your News directory. There is some differences in systems, but
on my system, under ~pfarrell is a ~/News directory. For
sci.crypt, look for the equivalent to ~/News/sci/crypt or create
the needed directories. In this directory, create a file named
KILL (case important) containing the following line:

/^From:.*strnlght@netcom.com/h:j

Of course, if you are tired of me, the line would be

/^From:.*pfarrell@cs.gmu.edu/h:j

With these lines, no postings will bother your reader. You will
still have to look for replies from other users to posting from me
or David, but as more folks use the KILL facility, there will be
fewer replies.

I can not address one of David's favorite arguments, the ethics of
wasting net bandwidth and thousands of people's time waiting for
KILL files to work. I don't like KILL files for this reason. But
sometimes they are needed.

True,  I guess I wasn't clear in that last statement.  The press release
indicated that the patent was pending, and depending upon what stage it is
in at present, an applicant might just want to hold off releasing any data
concerning such an idea until the patent has been issued.  It is theoreticaly
true that an applicant is protected from the day the application is submitted,
from any subsequent applications, but it might just be wise to hold off
releasing any details until the application is fully recognized as a original
idea and issued a patent.

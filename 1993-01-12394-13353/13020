Once again, to releive the misinformation, the RFD was originally sent
out in late December, just to start discussion.  It was also sent to
news.announce.newgroups at the same time, but it was not posted until
January 7, so the official date that the discussion period began was Jan
7.  

Please move all followup of this topic to news.groups, instead of
leaving it here and contributing to the problems we are attempting to
solve.

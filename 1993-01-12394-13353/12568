It strikes me as improbable that they could enforce such a copyright.
The courts have ruled that to be copyrighted, a work must be a creative
act.  In the particular case I'm thinking of, it was ruled that a phone
book could not be copyrighted, since no creativity went into it.

In this case, there is creativity in how the numbers are created -- but
copyright protects the expression, not the ideas, and an algorithm is
not subject to copyright.  It may be patentable -- but as far as I know,
their patent has not yet been issued.

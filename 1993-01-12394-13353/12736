Let me first politely ask that you limit the length of your lines. Run-over
lines are hard to read.

 
Your last point might be questioned. There are some good integer relation
finding algorithms (Ferguson & Forcade, for example and improvements)
that allow one to very quickly determine that the number is the root of
an integer, based upon just the first few digits.  Once that is determined,
finding the rest of the key is trivial. 

The same would be true for any ALGEBRAIC irrational.

Define "expensive". Using FFT multiplies, once could compute a square

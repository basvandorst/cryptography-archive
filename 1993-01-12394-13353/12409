     Excellent point here.  The very simple point is that having some
basic scrambling of the signal is better than not at all!  The person
person having a scanner wwhose intentions is to eavdrop could face possible
consequences according to the law.  This reason alone makes having some
simple, basic private feature of scrambling well worth the few extra
bucks!  However, the question of how good the security one gets, surely
is not the best unless one wants to pay big bucks.
	I bought a Motorola Model 100, the first model of the series, that
offers the privacy feature spoken above.  I am very pleased with the phone,
since it is half the size of my older AT&T 5300, but has 10 channels to
scan instead of the three.  But also, it does have a 3 volume level control
for amplication of received signals which is a big plus for me, since I am
hard of hearing and wear hearing aids --- also, it is hearing-aid compatible,
which some cordless phones are not.

	Another good point.  However, I had asked AT&T if they plan to
come out this year with a cordless phone having some kind of privacy feature,
they said no.  I don't think Motorola was trying to fool me; I knew what
this was and was very basic scrambling of the signal.  But again, having it,
for at least the reason listed above, makes it worth it.

	What specfic information does the Tropez 900 have? How does it
compare in price to the Motorola or Radio Shack Model?  Are we talking about
$150-$200 for a basic model or $400-600?

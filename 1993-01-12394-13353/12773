I know how to do this using a lattice basis reduction algorithm, (such
as LLL) but don't know the Ferguson & Forcade refrence - can you post a
citation?  (I think the "first few digits" would have to be on the
order of the height of the underlying minimal polynomial, but that's still
not much info...)

(I asked publically since others may be interested as well.)

Thanks,

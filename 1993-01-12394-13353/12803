Summary: RIPEM, minus RSAREF, is now freely available
X-Newsreader: TIN [version 1.1 PL6]
Xref: msuinfo alt.security.ripem:82 sci.crypt:12803

A copy of RIPEM 1.0.3 source code, with all cryptographic code
removed, is now available via anonymous FTP from ripem.msu.edu.
I am now reasonably certain that this code is exportable, so
non-USA users can now get it.  Without RSAREF, RIPEM is just
a big mail header parser/DER-encoder/command-line parser/etc.

Note that the code will not compile and link, and it certainly
won't run, due to the lack of RSAREF and RSAREF's header files.

The filename is /pub/crypt/ripem/ripem-1.0.3-no-crypto-stuff.tar.Z.
It includes RIPEM documentation, which is very short on 
cryptographic theory.

This code is in the public domain.

The export restrictions on the binaries and the full source
distribution remain in effect.

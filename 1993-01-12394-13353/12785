   Ed Hamrick raises the new question of whether a book available at

   If Ed wants to pursue this, an interesting and amusing experiment
   would be to call the book's publisher and ask if they will fulfill
   prepaid mail orders for that book from outside COCOM countries--say
   Iraq or Cuba or the PRC.

Stick with China for examples like this.  Cuba's a special case,
covered by the Trading With The Enemy laws, which somehow apply even
though we haven't declared war on them.  Folks who live in the Land of
the Free and Home of the Brave can't even go to visit Cuba except by
special government permission (mainly given to educational groups and
journalists) without getting thrown in jail for visiting that
totalitarian country -- if you can't legally buy one of their cigars,
selling them books about how to hide communications from governments
is not likely to be legal either, unless you work for Ollie North.

Bush's pardon of his co-conspirators shows that he is, in the end, still a wimp.

These number stations have been with us for many many years. I think the
best description of how they work including what the number messages are
made of, indicator signals and the like can be gotten from Peter Wright's
banned book, "Spycatcher."  This is a espionage classic full of real looking 
stuff.  In the book they describe capturing the agents "pad" for these 
transmissions and searching for other agents by going airborn and looking for
faint local oscillator signals of  any receiver on the ground tuned 
into the transmissions.  Its probabily the best description I've ever seen
of the number stations and their missions.

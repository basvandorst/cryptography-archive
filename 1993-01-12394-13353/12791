        David, chill out. There is nothing in Phil's response that
        indicates a confrontational attitude. He is clearly open to
        the possibility that his implementation of MD5, RSA or IDEA
        are faulty. On the otherhand, it's harder to accept a
        suggestion that these methods are inherently weak. Phil is
        right that this needs some reproducible experimental data.

        Unfortunately, the text is so bad that there's no way to be
        certain just what Sidelnikov _is_ saying. It's hardly
        convincing if you consider that, if David is right, these are
        the people that have spent their lives decrypting US, British,
        and Canadian messages. Surely one of them, or someone they
        know, must actually speak the language?

        Can Sidelkov have such an ego that none of his people had the
        courage to suggest improvements to his text? Given David's
        description of the man, this is hardly likely.

        PARANOIA ON:
        Could this be ploy? If it is, PGP must be pretty darned good!
        :PARANOIA OFF

        David, that's a good idea. Why don't you take a little time
        from shilling for RSA and spend it with Sidelnikov. You could
        bring to him our real concern and help the rest of us
        understand what he is trying to warn us about.

        Cheers,
                Marc

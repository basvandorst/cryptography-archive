OK, let's see.  Break out the old, klunky hot-box computer.  Warm up 
the solder gun.  Use an I/O port to "press" the buttons on the unit, and
read the output with a(n infrared?) detector.  Push RUN, let it go for
awhile, and then look at the gathered data.  It may not be trivially
easy (the funnest things often aren't), but it doesn't have to be slow. 
Just a-dreamin'...

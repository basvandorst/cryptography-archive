I should remind everyone that Sidelnikov did not present his work in
a paper for review or even make the post in question.  His post
was translated by a third person and forwarded here as a point of 
interest.  

What I saw in this thread that greatly disturbed me was a) his 
statements were nitpicked to a degree appropriate to a refereed 
presentation without his having been aware that it was going to 
happen and b) people assaulted the man, his credentials, the quality
of the English translation, the channel from which the message came
from instead of considering the validity what was said.  This seemed
to me like an underling patent inspector walking up to a WWII
german nuclear scientist and whispering "e=mc2" and the only
response being "Dirty Jew, off to the chambers."  Some of the 
"Sternglass factor" is understandable but I felt it got out of 
control.

Maybe I'm being overly sensitive or maybe it is that I forsee the need
for ordinary citizens to protect itself against the goverment,
but I NEED a secure crypto system.  Considering PKP's links to government
work, I'd surely never trust their package.   I'd have problems with
ANY binary-only package that could not be analyzed algorithm by algorithm.
The only way I can have confidence in a crypto package is if I see it get 
rigorous, brutal public scrutiny.  I saw that not happening here where it 
appeared people with interest in the product were retrenching.

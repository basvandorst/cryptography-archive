Gentlefolk,

        From what I have seen in usenet (as well as bars, clubs and
        social history), the only way to successfully partition
        sci.crypt will be for those with the incentive to make the
        move to make it. (Do the groups with the most dots in their
        names represent the frontiers of the cyberverse?)

        Making a sci.crypt.research|theory group will give the Verner
        Von Braun segment (vunz ze rockets go up, who cares verr zey
        komm down?) a place to have mature scientific discussions
        without interruptions from the real world. :-)

        It would seem appropriate for one of the mature scientists to
        paddle a RFD down to news.groups.

        FLAME ON:
        I'm not sure who used the word, but "hobbyist" is not the
        only alternative to "scientist" and it's an inappropriate
        discount. There are a bunch of us non-specialists here who
        have a serious professional interest in the _application_ of
        cryptography. You may recognise us as the people who
        ultimately provide the justification for your cryptology by
        providing a context for your cryptography. For us, the
        politics and logistics are just as important as the science
        and, without us, cryptology papers are write-only memory.
        :FLAME OFF

        I hope the specialists will continue to hang around to discuss
        these issues, whether or not a new group is formed. Maybe we
        can all make a New Year's Resolution to leave the guns and
        pederasts out of it.

        Happy New Year,

                        Marc

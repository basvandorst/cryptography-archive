 Bull point. 
 
 The better the cryptography, the greater the need to attack an 
 information security system obliquely through its peripheral 
 vulnerabilities or lax management.
 In private hands, too often the discipline to build and maintain a 
 complete and strong security system is missing - even antipathetic to 
 libertarian concepts. Information security requires thinking through from 
 A-Z and to be made just as strong as as particular circumstances sensibly
 require.

 I think you correctly identify a potential vulnerability. What you or I 
 do about it is up to us an not the writers of PGP. Close attention must
 reveal many other potential weaknesses beyond the control of the writrs.
 To be fair, Phil Zimmermann points this out and alludes to several 
 potential causes of concern in PGP's documentation. 
 
 Fundamentally, security is always a relative term.

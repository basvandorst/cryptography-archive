Why do you say that? You can detect the "ends against the middle"
attack against DH if the parties sign their DH exchanges (using RSA or
some other digital signature scheme) and verify them before using the
DH-generated key to encrypt anything real.

The most I think an active attacker could do against this scheme is to
trick the parties into revealing their public key certificates, if
that matters.

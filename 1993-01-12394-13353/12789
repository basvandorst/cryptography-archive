Does anyone know of a public key encryption system available for the
Macintosh?  If not, can someone tell me what would be involved effort
and money-wise in getting a license to write/use one.  Since it would
be for domestic use only, there should be no problems with the law.
However, I am not sure what is involved in the patent on the algorithms
themselves.

If anyone can help out, please mail to me directly and let me know.
Thanks a bundle in advance!

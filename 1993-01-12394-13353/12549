Sorry if this has been brought up, but don't many compression programs put
some type of table at the start of the compressed file (defining what
characters map to what uncompressed sequences, for example)?  If this is
the case, doesn't this give your opponent some extra info., just like
partially know plain text?  This would more than compensate for the extra
2^4 or whatever factor introduced in the attacker's work function.  Seems
like you'd have to be careful to avoid this (although I don't know how you
would).

Just my $0.02 worth...

Last night I was reading an account of the Beale ciphers, and I recalled
that twenty years ago when I was in college there was a flurry of activity
in the journals from people trying to crack them. I haven't heard anything
since then, so I was wondering:

Are people still working on these, or has is the general concensus that
they were hoax?

Of course, I suppose that if they weren't a hoax and if someone did crack
them, they might not broadcast that fact :).

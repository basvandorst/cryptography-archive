I can see that this kind of thing is discussed alot here, so
I'd prefer not to rehash old ideas in open forum, please
respond by email...

---

I would like to advise the author of a large public access
BBS network of adding public-key encryption to his s/w
as a regular feature (the BBS could be configured to keep
individual user's keys on-file by that user).

I would like referrals to comprehensive/novice sources
that could prime me on the issues on hand.  A common one
that comes to mind is, what legal responsiblities/conflicts
occur in a network setting - and would encryption such
as RSA (not sure what it stands for) be a perceived threat
to government such to the point of cracking down on the
said network?

I see the potential for legal abuses, and wonder if
mandatory storage of user's keys be required to protect
the sysop's butt...  Then again, encrypted communication
provided by some public access cellular phones could be
an appropriate model to argue over...

Fairly brief summary statements are appreciated, but
I'm also quite willing to dig for myself with a bit of
help from the technowizbangs present here.

maybe the fact that TeX is available for just about every platform
ever made for practically nothing? or the fact that anyone who does
math/paper typsetting probably uses it?

well good for you. if you wanted light & fluffy educational material
you should have turned on Sesame Street. i found the serious discussion

TeX -is- near universal, silly. maybe you should catch up with the 
rest of the world instead of insulting someone who went to a lot of 
work simply 'cause he didn't pander to you.

looking forward to more serious & insightful stuff,
jason

PS: previous to this, i didn't quite understand just why people despised
    David so much. it's painfully obvious now...

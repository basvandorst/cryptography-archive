In response to Graham Toal, if I'm not mistaken, Tex is a Unix
language for typesetting mathematical formulas. That's quite different
from being a language for communicating formulas in ASCII messages,
particularly when one has no idea if the intended recipient even uses
Unix. I concede that Unix nerds like to use Tex to show their nerdhood
in messages, but it's not the real world. (If you don't like nerd,
expert will do--I'm not trying to start a fight about "nerd", and I'm
using nerd in the same sense Bill Gates and others I respect do when
they call themselves nerds.)

Tex is not designed to be read, but to be translated by a machine into
nicely printed formulae. To use it to communicate directly (as
distinct from passing something to be translated and printed) seems to
me to be an example of the arrogance of the priesthood at its worst.

It's just silliness to say $/dots (or whatever Tex uses) in an ascii
message, when ... is accurate and direct, to name just one example.

Fortran's conventions, for example, are much more widely understood
(if you don't like that, Basic will do) for routine mathematical
expressions in ordinary typed mail than Tex. 

Please don't tell someone with a Ph.D. in Economics with Mathematical
Economics specialization that the standard language for communicating
mathematical formulae in electronic mail is Tex. That's simply false,
though some immersed in Unix who have lost sight of the real world may
think it true.

Finally, let's recall that the message was intended for Sidelnikov,
whose message was originally on a Russian internal net which we have
no reason to believe uses Unix.

A little fairness and balance in this discussion would go a long way.

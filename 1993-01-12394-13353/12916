Yes, as usual, you are *very much* mistaken.  Troff is a Unix typesetting
language; TeX is a free, multi-platform (VAX, IBM mainframe, IBM PC, Atari,
Amiga, Data General, Cray, Acorn Archimedes, Mac, etc.) typesetting language
which is also very good at typesetting mathematical formulae (Knuth wrote it
so he could typeset mathematical textbooks).

On the contrary, many netters resort to embedding fragments of TeX in
plain ASCII messages - you are na\"\ive to think otherwise.

As always, you are missing the point - the original message could (stripped
of it's headers) be passed straight to TeX to be typeset.  The bulk of
TeX source is plain ASCII text (just like this).

Yes, but if you feed `...' into TeX it comes out as three full stops, whereas
$\dots$ generates an ellipsis (the dots are spaced out a little).  Using
$\dots$ instead of `...' is a sign of attention to typographical detail.
Please remember that the article in question *was* TeX source, but still
human-readable (to those competent to comprehend the mathematics - who
are almost certainly familiar with TeX).

Which planet do you live on?  Fragments of programming language may
often be used to describe algorithms, *not* mathematics.  If you don't
believe me, try expressing an equation involving integrals in FORTRAN.

Looking at the world around me, I find it hard to relate economics to
mathematics.  Arithmetic of the `2+2=5' variety practiced by economists
maybe, mathematics no.

Unix has nothing to do with it.  TeX is widely used in eastern-bloc
countries.

Why don't you try contributing some, for once?

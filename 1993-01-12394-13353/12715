Bob Cain says
"The problem between RSA and Phil is very, very complicated and the way
it all came down it deserves to be if you hear both sides."

Given that my view of that situation is thought partisan by some,
I'd be very interested to hear Bob's view, since there can be no
doubt he's not a fan of mine.

The reason I ask is his characterization of Jim Bidzos as reasonable
and tough. I'd agree with that, so perhaps those who don't care for
my views about the RSA/PGP situation might be more able to hear what
Bob has to say about that (not knowing in advance what that might be).

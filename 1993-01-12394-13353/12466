As some posts indicate there are actual bills before congress on
this topic, can anyone post exactly what they are?  If we wish to organize
some sort of letter-writing campaign, we'll need to cite H.R such and
such or Senate Resolution such and such to reference the bill.  Otherwise,
our letter is certainly futile, because the congressional aide that
reads it won't have the foggiest idea of what we're talking about, probably
even if their boss sits on the committee.

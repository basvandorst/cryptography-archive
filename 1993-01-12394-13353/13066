Nope.  I'd pin it closer to a second after thinking about it.  It was
hard to miss with the conversant standing next to me.  That is not
such a big deal in practice.  I'm told by a modem manufacturer that
to see such delays in the switching system is not uncommon.

: Like you said, the source this kind of delay is "curious".

Most.  Must be using framing with very big blocks or a very slow
cipher.  IDEA will do it introducing only about 100 us delay on
a 16 bit microcontroller.

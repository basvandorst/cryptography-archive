Yes, definitively there is. The download statistics for the directory
of our ftp site that I manage show that my collection of public keys
has been downloaded 3-4 times more often than any anti-virus program.
And the directory mentioned is supposed to be an anti-virus site, not
a PGP public key server... :-))) So, interest is guaranteed...

Seems a good idea to me. As a beginning, you could take a look at my
collection of public keys - it currently contains 425 keys. It is
available as

	ftp.informatik.uni-hamburg.de:/pub/virus/misc/pubkring.pgp

(don't forget to set mode to binary before downloading).

Unfortunately, I am still maintaining this collection "manually". It
would be nice if somebody sets up an automatic server that can be
contacted by e-mail and provide different services - like key
registration and revoking, update of the keyrings of other servers,
etc.

Regards,
Vesselin

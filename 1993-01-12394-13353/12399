Another question, gentlemen, if you would:
Is there a program available that actually uses the RSA algorithm for the 
encryption?
When one says they "assume the spooks have been able to break the DES" is 
that assumed to be in CBC or only in ECB mode?
Anyone know the longest product of primes that has been factored, time 
taken, and what increase there might be in the next 20 years in speed?
Again, thanks in advance

Try and get hold of back issues of the scholarly journal "Cryptologia",
available at many (probably larger) libraries (university libraries, perhaps).

There have been articles on this topic fairly regularly as well as articles
on the Polish contributions to the Enigma decipherment, which is a strongly
related topic.

See also the FAQ for an address.  They may sell back issues; I don't remember.

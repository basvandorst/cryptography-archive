I am looking for books or chapters of books which discuss in any way,
the history of cryptography.  I want examples of uses of cryptography
in the past, or examples of methods of cryptography that were used in
the past.  

I currently have
    The Code Breakers by David Kahn
    The Puzzle Palace by James Bamford
on my list.  

Can anyone suggest other references?

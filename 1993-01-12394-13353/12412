Plaintext encryption can be used to militarily disarm an 
enemy.  Suppose all traffic of an organization was first 
encrypted in meaningful plaintext that was at least 
partially empricially verifiable.  Then >this< plaintext 
was encrypted with a compromisable standard-issue 
encrpytion scheme, and an adversary was given the 
means to decrypt this  cover-decrypt,  and read the 
plaintext.  Now give the adversary a  Coventry-type 
situation.  Your true message may be:  We need a sack 
of potatoes for the officers s dining room at base such 
and such.   But the encrypted message (plaintext) reads : 
 We have decided to bomb location [The  Coventry ], 
and destroy adversary x s radar equipment.   This 
plaintext message is then encrypted, in say, DES, and 
transmitted through the usual channels.  Some latter-day 
Churchill on the adversary s side may decide to let the 
radar facility be bombed, to preserve his ability to 
monitory DES-level communicaitons.  The originator of 
the message may >have< to bomb the radar facility, to 
maintain the illusion that the plaintext encrypt is actually 
a plaintext decrypt.  Isn t the spy business fun?

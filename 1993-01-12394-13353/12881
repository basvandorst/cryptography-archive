Yes, but he is asking us to accept his statements as fact, he needs to
back them up.  PERIOD. Referreed journal or not.

That's because a useful response was posted by Zimmerman asking for more
information, I felt the response was reasonably respectful, David turned
it into the flamefest it became and we allowed him to.

I return to my message which I side stepped which is that, when people
make incredible claims, they need to back them up and explain their
methodology.  If they can't do that, then we don't just ignore the
claims, but we needn't elevate the claims to the status of proof and
certainty.

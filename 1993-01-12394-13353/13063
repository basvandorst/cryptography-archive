 I see no particular reason to believe that it would be "infeasible"
 to spoof two channels, when it is "relatively easy" to spoof one.

 Assuming we are talking about spoofing on a store-and-forward
 computer network, if spoofing programs were already in place,
 spoofing an additional channel might involve adding just one more
 name to an already long list.  This would be essentially zero
 incremental cost per additional spoofed channel, even for those
 few spoofers who would be burning their own CPU time.

This is called VLBI (Very Long Baseline Interferometry). You make
*simultaneous* high speed recordings of a single source at widely
spaced sites.  The recordings must preserve the amplitude *and phase*
of the incident EM radiation, and they must be very precisely
timestamped (to allow accurate alignment when the signals are
combined). Although this is practical (although tricky) at radio
frequencies, I *seriously* doubt the technology is in hand to do it at
optical frequencies on a satellite. I don't think there are any A/D
converters yet that can sample at the Nyquist rate for green light,
for example.

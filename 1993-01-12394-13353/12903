Having seen all of the pro-con discussion of Tex, WHAT IS IT?  I had 
no difficulty reading it, but am unfamiliar with it.  I ONLY work on 
PCs, do not use Unix, and do not use mainframes.  My field is PC 
Security, not Host systems.

Is it available for the 8088 family of Intel chips?  Is it available 
in a DOS/Windows 'flavour'?

Sorry for this small side issue, but I would probably have the same to 
say for Fortran... never could make sense of that particular 
language, other then read the formuli.

e-Mail to <robert.heuman@rose.com> please.... via InterNet direct.
Lets not clutter Crypt up with the responses.

Bob

Get off your high horse David!

TeX is a Mathematics/CS standard for all intents and purposes in this
country.  As a Math major, I am required to write my thesis in TeX,
primarily to give familiarity.

Lastly, once you have learned a small bit a bout TeX, it is easy to
ignore the formatting commands.  Perhaps you would prefer he gave
everything in eqn preprocessor commands.

In his article he cited formulas from Knuth and other places which in my
opinion were useful to me.  And being able to read the article in TeX
was helpful.

Lastly, at least he gives refernces about the random number issue which
was one of the points, I was trying  to make.  The procedures you use to
determine statistical correlation are important.  Sidelnikov provides no
reference to his procedure.  As Stephan's post points out, depending on
the type of statistical correlation you do, the results may not be what
Sidelnikov expected.

Now, I wouldn't recommend that we all bury our heads in the sand and
pretend that PGP is perfect, but if someone wants to present flaws and
have them corrected, they need to explain method and so forth so that as
mathematicians/CS people we can make intelligent decisions about
replacement.

Also, David, you have never responded to the person explained the MD5
challenge, that is to show different strings that hashed to the MD5 for
some specific strings.  If Sidelnikov is _so_ knowledgeable, and MD5 is
weak, then he should be able to beat that challenge, if PGP has
misimplimented MD5, then he should give two message texts that PGP MD5's
to the same value.

Rigorous mathematical proofs are an important part of serious Computer
Science in this country and most others.  If Sidelnikov wants the
respect you seem to believe he deserves then he is going to have to meet
the standards of proof and peer review present in this and other
countries.

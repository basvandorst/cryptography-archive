John -

  Please read the sci.crypt FAQ.  Keeping your algorithm a secret is
no good, because if we really wanted to crack your file we'd break into
your house or apartment first to get everything off your hard disk, and
then try to tap all your email to see if you mentioned anything relevant.
"Security by Obscurity" is a fallacy.  The encryption system is only
secure if *everyone* knows how it works, and cannot find any flaws.

  Otherwise, you only *think* it's secure, when in fact someone who knows
how it works has already told the "bad guys."  Believe it - anyone who
really wants to know more about how your encryption system works WILL FIND
OUT whether you know about it or not.

  Sorry, but you probably won't get any takers unless you either supply
the algorithm or make it worth the time by offering a financial incentive.

  Of course, if it's simple someone who's bored might give it a shot with
the standard attacks.

  Good luck!

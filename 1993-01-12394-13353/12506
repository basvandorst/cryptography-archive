Claus Tondering posts a message containing a common misunderstanding.
U.S. crypto laws do not prohibit the export (or import) of crypto
techniques and materials. They prohibit such export or import without
a license.  The government has behaved in such a way that at present
we know that such licenses will not be issued for certain specific
techniques, such as DES and RSA.

Maybe the Word Perfect Corporation got a license for the technique
used in Word Perfectc.

I'm sorry, it got too much for me.  I could resist no longer.

Quoting strnlght@netcom.com (David Sternlight) in article <1993Jan11.002136.15202@netcom.com>:
>I invite others who don't wish to read messages from me for whatever

>since they are counterbalanced by the "keep up the good work"
>messages.

Quite apart from the irrelevance of such messages, I don't believe you. 
I'd really, genuinly like to see articles from anyone other than David
Sternlight who takes any part of his views on PGP and ITAR.

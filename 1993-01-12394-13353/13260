Can I find info on satellite encryption here?

I see many interesting discussions here, where can one obtain the FAQ?

I'm very interested in satellite television.  I would love to exchange and comp
are ideas in the field.  I would also like to obtain the source code for GI bus
ter / phaser or any other related software.
I hope I am allowed to discuss these topics?

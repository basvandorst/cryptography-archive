Yes, very much so.  Pick up any copy of CRYPTO 'nn -- or better yet,
EUROCRYPT, or AUSCRYPT, or -- well, you get the picture.  (And if you
don't get it, I'm sure most of the other readers of this newsgroup do,
especially those who aren't Americans.)

Yes, Americans have done well in cryptography.  So have a lot of others.
I won't bore -- and insult -- the readership by trying to assign proportional
credit to different nationalities.

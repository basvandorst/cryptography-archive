There are a few differences.  The wavelength of the radio waves in
question are much longer than the light waves.  Therefore, the precision
with which the image receivers must be places is more stringent for the
optical methods.  It's just not too easy.  I'm not saying that it 
can't or isn't being done.  It's just difficult to accomplish.

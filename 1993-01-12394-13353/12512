I'm one of the people the "broke" the codes.  It isn't that simple.

The algorithm starts out being quite simple for single digit codes, and
gets more and more complex for each digit you add.  The VCR Plus+
algorithm is desinged so that common shows map to shorter numbers -
which reduces the average number of digits you have to type.  The shorter
the code, the more "typical" the show time.

The algorithm gets more complex every time you add another digit.  There
is no second algorithm for 7 and 8 digit codes.  We just lost interest
in the project and stopped working on it before solving the 7 and 8 digit
codes.

Those routines (as far as I know - I haven't looked at them that closely
yet) are an implementation of our algorithm - the one that was published
in Cryptologia.

As far as I know, no one has made in progress on the 7 and 8 digit codes.
However, like all the digits before, it's most likely just an extension
of the algorithm used on the shorter codes.  The 6 digit algorithm stops
in the middle of a range of shows.  I'm sure the 7 digit algorithm picks
up where the 6 digit algorithm stops.

However, the change in the algorthim from the 6 to 7 digit codes seems
more complex than the change from the 5 to 6 digit codes.

Not really.  Most of it is is algorithmic.  However, there are tables
used in the algorithm.  The day and channel are calculated without the
use of any tables, and most of the start times and durations are also
calculated without the use of tables.  And I wouldn't be surprised if
the one table that is used could be replaced with an algorithm.

The algorithm was created by many, many hours of research.  We never
looked at the ROMs in the VCR Plus+ device (assuming it has ROMs), so I
have no idea what you could learn (or would find) by doing that.

You don't have to collect published codes, you can just sit down with the
VCR Plus+ device and start punching in numbers.  But there are 9,999,999
7 digit codes (and each one requires 9 button presses to test), so it can
take a long time to get enough numbers.

This is at least part of why we stopped working on the codes.  It was
taking too much time.

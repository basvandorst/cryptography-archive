This is not necessarily true.

Simple inversion helps me against my neighbor with a cordless phone (unless
it's another Motorola).  It doesn't help me against anyone wanting to
eavesdrop for real.

As long as I know how good (bad) it is, it helps, I suppose.

If I ever let myself believe it's really secure, I'll be seduced into
behaving with it as if I had privacy -- and would therefore reveal more
than I should.

In that case, "some basic scrambling" is far worse than having no
scrambling at all.

The best case would be the old ham radio sets with speakers and microphones
-- no headphones, no phone handsets -- with the large antenna outside the
window -- reminding you constantly that your words are being broadcast.

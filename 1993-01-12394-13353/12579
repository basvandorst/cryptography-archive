My reading of the English language seems to be somewhat different
from Ed Hamrick's. His quoted material is shot through with what he
calls "weasel words" and restrictions of all sorts, and is not as
open and shut as he would like to make it seem. Apologies for not
editing more than I've done--I'm only trying to show various
kinds of restrictions in the language. Not all apply to the current
case:

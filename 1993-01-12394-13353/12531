I have been looking for a program that uses the RSA for the actual 
message encryption, not just for the DES or IDEA key. I found an old copy 
of a program called Iris, produced in England by a Mr. Peter Moreton at 
Digital Crypto. Apparently this Iris does just that, but it's hard to 
tell from the cryptic help file. Does anyone know of this program? It 
also has the DES and several other ciphers, but they are all in one big 
.exe file. Thanx in advance...

It is worth noting that the single biggest industrial supercomputing usage is for
finite element analysis (which for this discussion can be equated to finite
difference analysis, spectral methods and finite voilume methods).  A quick and
dirty first look at the issue might be to check out Segerlind Introductory fintie
element analysis book  NOte however, the bulk of the literature is based on
forming the global matrices,  it is not clear that one would want ot form the
global matrices for a highly parallel machine.
 
Good luck!!

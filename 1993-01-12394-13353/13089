Yes. The NSA calls such codes ``non-strategic.'' My understanding from
talking to the NSA is that the State Department will routinely transfer
jurisdiction over non-strategic encryption object code to the Commerce
Department. I assume that the WordPerfect encryption system is
non-strategic; and certainly WordPerfect is distributed as object code.

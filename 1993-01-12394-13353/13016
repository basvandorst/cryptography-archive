  I'm writing an program and I'd like to use the IDEA algorithm for encryption.
I know that the licensing on IDEA permits it to be used freely for non-
commercial use.  What I'm wondering is whether there are import restrictions
on using IDEA in the US?  Are there any other hidden legal problems with it?
  Also, the only source that I know of for IDEA is from the PGP source
distribution, and I'd like to avoid the legal problems involved in that.
Where could I get a good implementation of it??
  Thanks.

Another article in today's `New Scientist', entitles `Spymasters fear bug-proof 
telephones' (p 19), reports that exports by European equipment vendors of GSM 
cellular phones to the Middle East are being blocked, because GCHQ in Britain 
and the FBI in the USA fear that the encryption algorithm used, called A5 and
described as similar to DES, will take `huge amounts of computer power' to
crack and thus hinder law enforcement. As a result, the UK Department of Trade
and Industry has asked for a different export standard, with weaker encryption
or none at all. This could result in the mobile phone market being captured by
US or Japanese vendors.

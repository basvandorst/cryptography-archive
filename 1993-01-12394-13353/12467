The patent doesn't include enough information to decode the VCR+ code.
It explains how to make/decode _a_ VCR code, but not _the_ VCR+ code.  That
is, there are a bunch of specific details you need that aren't included.  (As
an analogy, the RSA patent won't help you decode a particular RSA-encoded
message.)

   There are however, a large class of problems which have been demonstrated
   either to be computationally intractable or to be NP-complete (i.e. the time
   to solve the problem goes up at least exponentionally with the number of
   elements, and therefore a lower bound can be placed on the time required to
   solve the problem.)  My question is whether anyone has published any work on
   trying to derive public-key code systems from NP-complete problems?

It hasn't been done, but I think most people in the field are aware of
the potential.  Perhaps eventually someone (you?) will do it.

It should be remembered, actually, that no one has shown that
NP-complete problems take exponential time to solve, only that a
polynomial time solution for one implies a polynomial time solution
for all of NP.  Also just knowing that a problem has an exponential
time solution doesn't really allow you to put a lower bound on time
(except a very generous one).  All that exponential time tells you is
that the time taken to solve the problem is _proportional_ to e^x
where x is the problem size.

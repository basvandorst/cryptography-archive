Michael Sierchio posts the RSA Readme file dated March, 1992.
It's worth mentioning that the license that comes with RSAREF
currently is dated December and supersedes all previous
licenses, statements, etc. By agreeing to the license and getting
RSAREF/RIPEM, you agree to that supersession.

The README file of the license is freely available for ftp from
rsa.com.

If by circumstance you mean such things as a national decision to create
the NSA and spend a lot of money on it, I'd agree. Yet there's no reason
to believe this circumstance will not continue.

If by circumstance you mean the externals of non-governmental
support--academic department funding, tenure tracks, etc. I don't have
enough information to comment.

I will say that a few hackers copying someone else's program or
algorithm, or refining it don't a cryptographic dominance make. If it
did we wouldn't be having all those discussions about 'has the NSA
broken thus and so?', which sound to my ears like some of the fears of
developing countries in the face of the dominance of the
Industrialized ones in economic matters.

One caveat with respect to the U.K. GCHQ has made major contributions
and breakthroughs, and thus the (heretofore?) American dominance
might more accurately be described as Anglo-American dominance.

Finally, if by "natural" superiority you meant something nationally
inherent, I don't follow you because I don't know of anyone who
ever made THAT claim.

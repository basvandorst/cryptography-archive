This has other advantages, such as the ability to encrypt the same
message to multiple recipients by doing multiple encryptions of the
per-message key, as PEM and new versions of PGP allow.

Not all people have a Sparc 2 to do decryption on.  Plenty of people
have a 386 or smaller, because they believe it's insecure to do their
encryption on a timesharing platform like a workstation.  Indeed, the
added security of doing your crypt activity on a personal machine is
probably much greater than the dubious added security of encrypting
the whole message with RSA.

A minute is not a perfectly tolerable speed.  It would strongly
encourage the recipient to keep a copy of the plaintext in a file, so
that he won't have to wait the minute (or several, depending) to
decrypt if he wants to read it again.  This is not security.

It's unfortunate that you posted this anonymously, as this kind of
distracts from your arguments (which, while not compelling, are still
interesting.)

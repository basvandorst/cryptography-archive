   Example: several years ago, somebody with access to KH-11 spy photos
   sent some pictures of a Soviet aircraft carrier under construction to
   Jane's Defense Weekly. The photos were secret, and this guy ended up
   going to jail. But Aviation Week then picked up and ran the same
   photos, and so did William Burrows' book "Deep Black". And you didn't
   hear a peep about this because the photos were already public.

For what it's worth, one of these photos made the back page of _The Times_
(of London).  It was printed quite large -- about 7" by 4" -- and showed
lots of detail.  I remember being somewhat surprised that pictures of
that quality were being published in a national newspaper.

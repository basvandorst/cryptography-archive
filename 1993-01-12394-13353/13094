Wrong, Sternlight. GTDA is quite straightforward. If the Commerce
Department had control over (e.g.) PGP, then GTDA would permit export
of PGP. The only problem is that the Commerce Department does not have
this control.

Sternlight, do you mean to imply that RSADSI ``owns'' any implementation
of the RSA algorithm? Even if the RSA patent is upheld in court, and even
if Joe Shmoe is found to be infringing upon the patent, Joe owns copyright
in anything he wrote. If, on the other hand, you simply mean to say that
RSADSI owns *its own* code (meaning RSAREF), then who cares? Nobody's
violating RSADSI's copyrights.

 Tsk, tsk, David!

 What sort of red herring is 'unclassified territory'? What matters (in 
 context) is whether or not the subject or subject's activity is government 
 classified information that it is illegal to possess unless 
 specifically authorised to do so. Not even your spectacular sophistries 
 have yet conjured up Government classification for PGP. Come to think of 
 it.......I wonder why ever not??

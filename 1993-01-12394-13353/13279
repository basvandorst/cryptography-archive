Does anyone have PGP 2.1 compiled and running for the Sun 4 (Sparc) who
would give me a copy of the executable.  

I got the sources, and they seem to compile.  However, I get a run-time
error when I try to generate the first key.  Something about bad ioctl
when it asks me what key length.

Instead of beating my head over this, I hope that I can just get a 
running version from someone.

Thanks 
Jeff

A good introductory book on cryptograhy is NIST special publication 800-2
called Public-Key Cryptograhy" by James Nechvatal  April 1991

Contents:
Cryptosystems and crypanalysis
Key Management
Digital Signatures and Has Functions
Examples of public key systems and hash functions
Implementations of public key cryptography
Sample proposal for a Lan Implementation 

Appendix
Mathematical and Computational Aspects
Algorithmw and architectures
The classicla theory of computation
theory of probablistic computing
breaking knapsacks
Birthday attacks
Modular arithmetic and Galois Fields
Euclid's Algorithm
Chinese Remainder theorem
Primative Roots and discrete logs
Primality tests
Mathematics of RSA
Quadratic residuosity modulo a compositite
introduction to zero knowledge proofs
alternatives to diffie/hellman model


The text is 162 pages long and is not an in-depth examination of these
topics but a good introduction. Just right for the frequenctly asked
beginner questions.

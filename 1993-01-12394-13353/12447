Well, they do not have patented the mathematical algorithm. They have
pathented the usage of certain mathematical operation to implement a
communication system. That is, anybody is free to use modular
arithmetic in general, but usage of modular arithmetic for encrypted
and/or authenticated communication is patented.

Nope. RSA/PKP has filed a suit once or twice, but that matter was
always settled outside the court.

You are free to patent anything, if you succeed to convince the patent
office experts that this is something new.

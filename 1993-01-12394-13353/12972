This doesn't work -- some permutations will occur more often than
others.  For example, when n=3, random(3) is called 3 times to
generate a sequence z_1, z_2, z_3, where each z_i is an integer
between 1 and 3.  27 such sequences are possible, and each occurs with
probability 1/27.

The values of the z's completely determine the action of the rest of
the program.  In particular, they determine which output permutation
is produced.  If exactly k distinct sequences result in the same
output permutation pi, then prob[pi] = k/27.  But each of the 6
possible permutations should be equally likely, so we want prob[pi] =
1/6.  Hence, we need k/27 = 1/6, or k = 27/6 = 4 1/2.  But clearly k
is an integer; hence, no permutation occurs with the correct
probability of 1/6.

A similar but correct program was posted earlier in this same thread.

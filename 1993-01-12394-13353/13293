I hadn't heard this particular story, but it does seem that the
Soviets were fascinated with passive bugs. The most famous cause
occurred in the late 1950's/early 1960s when the Americans discovered
a passive bug hidden in a Great Seal of the US plaque that the Soviets
had given to the US embassy in Moscow. The bug consisted of a small
RF-resonant chamber with a thin diaphragm on one side. Sound waves
impinging on the diaphragm would vary the chamber's resonant frequency
slightly, and this could be detected by the returns from a microwave
"probe" beam aimed at the embassy.

Reports of microwave radiation aimed at the US embassy continued for
years past that (into the 1970s at least). Quite a bit of public
hysteria ensued about the dire health consequences, and the press
seemed to think it was a big mystery. My guess is that our government
knew exactly what the microwave beams were for, but they were content
to let the press dwell on the sensationalized health aspects instead
of confirming what we later found out anyway -- that the US embassy in
Moscow was riddled with bugs.

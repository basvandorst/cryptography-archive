At least the encryption part of it is quite possible with the vanilla
version of PGP2.1 as compiled fresh after an FTP from one of those sites
that carry it. I had the requirement of encrypting COPS reports sent
via e-mail to me from various machines (just because COPS reports may
contain info useful to a would-be attacker) and in the cops script
I did something like this:

       cat $REPORT | pgp -eaf $USER_PUBKEY | mailx -s"cops report" $USER

Too simple or am i missing something ?

Hope this helps unless I have completely misunderstood your requirements.

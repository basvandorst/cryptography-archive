Look for an article in the JACM, late 50's or early 60's, by Smith,
Klem, & Green, with title containing the phrase "..additive pseudo
random number generator.." or something like that.  It uses a
sort of generalized fibonacci method, with one integer addition
mod(word-size) per generated number, but requires a short array of
the most recent numbers to be kept from step to step.
The order of the authors may be Green, Smith, & Klem.

Hey Folks!

Being very hesitent to enter this fray but fed up with the ad hominems,
let's get back to serious discussion here.  Why is it that when people
get behind steering wheels or keyboards they turn homicidal???  Speaking
for all the folks out there who are interested in cryptography and all
the issues, let's try to reduce the signal-to-noise ratio here.  We
are supposed to be researchers and scientists, aren't we?

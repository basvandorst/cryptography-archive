I *HATE* anon posts.  I hope whoever posted this had a good reason for
doing so, but I would like to point out something...

You Didn't Fool Big Brother...

Don't you think it strange the anon posting system comes out of Finland?
Isn't it a wonderful site for isolated traffic capture...Anyone paranoid

I wish I knew who it was I agree with!  One of the reasons I like the
Internet is it is a forum of ideas where the individual is still of
importance...anon posts are just the opposite of PGP signed messages!

Like about half of the signed postings I have seen, Peter's arrived here
corrupted (NULL lines converted to lines with a single space in them).
This causes the messages to fail the signature check (it doesn't even
strip the armor correctly) until manually massaged.

Is this a problem for anyone else?  If so, perhaps the next release of pgp
should consider automatically stripping trailing blanks on "+clearsig" type
signed msgs, and perhaps try to account for other "mailer" type anomalies.

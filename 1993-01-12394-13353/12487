Phil,

Because even though it is much easier now that need not be true very
long.  DSP advancing as it is, I don't think that voice validation is a
very good thing to count on even though it is the best I can come up
with.  It is far from spoof-proof, just non-trivial.  I can envision a
DSP based system that does a frequency domain transformation to convert
the spectral content of one voice to another in real time.  You are
left of course with the nuances of voice that remain but I'll bet that
if the spectral transformation were performed those nuances would be
overlooked for the most part.  Hell, just do a simple frequency shift
of a voice and you probably will not recognize the speaker even if
well known.  Whether the converse is true, false recognition, I don't
know because I have never heard it but I just have a feeling.

Bob

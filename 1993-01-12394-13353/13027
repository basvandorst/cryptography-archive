I managed to order it from the local Borders a few months ago (I think
Borders is a chain, so there may be one near you).  It was about $70 for
the hardcover, and it took about a month and a half, but they eventually
got it for me.  If you can't find anywhere else that will order it, try
calling Borders in Pittsburgh and asking.  "The Codebreakers" is well
worth the trouble it takes to find a copy.

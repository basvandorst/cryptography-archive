Espionage? For obtaining unclassified information that is very widely
and readily available to anyone in the US? And outside too? First
there was NSA's brief threat to prosecute John Gilmore for what he
found in a public library. Now this.  My, what a country we live in.
With constitutional democracies like ours, who needs fascist
dictatorships?

You're a sure candidate for the Supreme Court the next time a
Republican takes the White House.

	Excellent point here.  The very simple point is that having some
   basic scrambling of the signal is better than not at all!


well, yes, but...


i don't remember the reference, but i think that during ww2, several
bell lab's engineers showed that a person could be trained to
understand speech inversion scramblers without any hardware aids.  the
scramblers in question were ones which permuted multiple bands in a
changing manner, and didn't just invert the entire band.

if people's ears can crack the system in real time without special
hardware then simple speech inversion really shouldn't be called a
security device.

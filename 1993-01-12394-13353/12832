I've seen a number of your post, but I felt I had to reply to this
one. I'm getting tired of these horse droppings, this is my last post
about this subject. I hope :)

Dave: You are putting words into someone else's message - read the
above. It's normal to try and read between the lines. It's something
else entirely to speak for someone else to try and support one's
arguments.

So Sidelnikov doesn't have to present figures but Phil has?

What doubts? Sidelnikov has written a study about pgp but he has
presented no data, no attacks, no hex dumps of the headers or
anything at all but words. Perhaps such a posting would be of
appropriate caliber for alt.news, but if I presented that style of
paper at my institution, I'd get a negative number for a grade.

Now, having never heard of Sidelnikov or had contact with Soviet
research before his posting, I won't talk of him directly. But for you to
compare him as the head of the cryptanalysis division of the NSA is
quite something else. If the NSA guys have half a brain in common,
they will always distribute information or disinformation (take your
pick) to their advantage. This means you can't trust them at there
word. Personnaly I'd find that insulting. But that's my opignon not
his.

Call me blind, but you're pulling at another person's straws.

And let me guess, if there' really smart, they'll use RIPEM? ;-)

I'd suggest dealing with everyone with politeness. However, you seem
to be more intested in his title than in what he actually wrote.
(Again no offence to Sidelnikov - I don't know his background).

 > Academicians are analogous to "the immortals".

Maybe I should put that word along with my name, next thing you know
Sternlight will agree with everything I said.

In short, Sidelnikov posted a study that was trying to poke holes at
pgp. That's normal procedure for any cypher. It contained not alot of
information, repeated some of the PGP documentation warnings and the
translation was a bit shaky on some phrases which I had trouble
myself to read. Phil wrote PGP and is trying to reinforce it's
programming. And as any good academicians would do he's questionning
someone else's theory and is hungry for details - not unlike Einstein,
Bell or Edison. It's that aggression, then is thinking is killing?

Cheap shot. There was a time where your post had some real sense in
them Sternlight. How about we go back to the good 'old days?

Again, you might want to check out the following:

  Gait, Jason, Validating the Correctness of Hardware Implementations of
  the NBS Data Encryption Standard, NBS Special Publication 500-200,
  Sept.  1980

Several tests with sample data are described which most people use to
validate DES implementations.  NIST is also very happy to perform a
remote validation test of your FIPS 113 MAC computations via their BBS.
If you pass, they'll add your implementation to their list of evaluated
products and award you with a nice (framed!)  "certificate of
appreciation" at the next National Computer Security Conference.  For
further info, check out:

  Smid, Miles, et al., Message Authentication Code (MAC) Validation
  System: Requirements and Procedures, NBS Special Publication 500-156,
  May 1988

Again, both are available through the NTIS.

Cheers,

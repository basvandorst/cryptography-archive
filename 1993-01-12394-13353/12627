	A patent is a **public record** describing an invention, it must
	include a detailed description of the invention and a set of
	claims that describe the invention for which the inventor
	demands an exclusive right or privilege.  All U.S. patents
	are published in the Official Gazette of the U.S. Patent and
	Trademark Office (at least a description of the invention is).

	There are exceptions, we recently had to deal with a patent
	issued in 1947 or 1948 dealing with nuclear weapons that had
	only recently been declassified, even though the patent rights
	had run out no later than 1965.  But, if the patent isn't
	classified, it should be available in the public domain.

	In addition, there are a number of databases covering the
	patent literature.  The most applicable to this case would be
	Derwent which is available through STN and Dialog.

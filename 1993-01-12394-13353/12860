   I, for one, have chosen not to use PGP for email communication through

The only problem about RIPEM is that it doesn't use certificates.  As
far as I'm concerned, if it doesn't use certificates, it's not useful.
Relying on a certificate server is tantamount to "authentication by IP
address", which is only one step above "authentication by assertion".

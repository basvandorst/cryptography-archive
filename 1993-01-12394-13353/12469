Look in alt.sources or rec.video.  There is a posting containing a shar
of code to encode/decode numbers and times.  Here is the description 
from the header:

This ZIP archive holds three files
X      readme.txt
X      encode.c
X      decode.c
X
X
decode.c is source program that reads a VCRPLUS code
number value you find in the newspaper and calculates
X    date_of_the_tv_program
X    starting_time_of_the_tv_program
X    run_length_of_the_tv_program
X
X
encode.c is source program that reads a date, start time,
and run length then turns them into a VCRPLUS code number
like the ones in the newspaper.


Good luck,

Greg

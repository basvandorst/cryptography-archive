A cover-plaintext encrypt is a topic of discussion used to create a 
 virtual reality  which conceals a true encrypted dialogue.  
Plaintext encryption allows the encrypting parties to use two 
channels of discourse- the  phony  channel which a skilled 
adversary will see when he decrypts, and the real, uncrackable 
channel that the phony channel represents.  I suggest for 
concealing commercial and industrial information, that the 
conversing parties rifle their files for every bad and impractical 
idea their respective R&D departments have rejected.  These 
ideas and all of the information filed with the ideas can be used to 
create a phony dialogue about the errant technology, which would 
conceal the real dialogue and technical information being 
exchanged.  Using controlled plaintext encryption, it is possible, 
using rule based expert systems and adequate discourse structure 
to create a fully encrypted artificial dialogue that contains all of 
the encrypted information.  Thus, when the clever adversary 
decrypts PGP 2.0 or DES or whatever, the adversary will only 
see an involved discussion about technical concepts that only after 
involved investigation will prove to be fruitless.  This is how 
technical information will be concealed in the future. 
Any comments?

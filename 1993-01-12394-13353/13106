I believe that William Unruh already answered this point.

By 'zero key' I meant all 56 bits zero, with the parity bits set
appropriately.  Thus, the key you give above.

I plan to offer MD4 and MD5 as alternatives, and I repeat my request to
have a list of the weak and semi-weak keys sent to me via email.  I'm also
writing an 80386 assembly language implementation of DES, and I'd like my
en/decryption program to complain if one of these keys is used.

I'd also appreciate a few sets of plaintext+key+ciphertext via email so
that I can verify that my implementation is correct.

If you are trying to secure the network, and if you can trust the
machines that you are trying to secure, then I suggest you look into
Kerberos (comp.protocols.kerberos, or kerberos@mit.edu).  It is based
on DES, and uses shared secrets between entities to prove
authenticity.

It doesn't sound like you need real-time key distribution, which is
something that Public Key algorithms have over secret-key algorithms,
but if you have physical access to both machines, then you can place a
shared secret on both machines and now that link is secure...

I hope this helps.  If you have any more questions, feel free to ask.

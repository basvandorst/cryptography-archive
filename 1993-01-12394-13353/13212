I'd assume that English text has some redundancy in the lowest bits when
ASCIIized. Thus, not 100% random given a suitable definition of that word.

You could grab each article and create its MD5 signature. You'd probably
have to be somewhat imaginative so that knowledge of the sequence of
articles arriving at your machine won't reveal the random number.

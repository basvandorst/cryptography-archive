(Please, David, don't flame me for using BiBTeX format for the
references, okay?  I'm already having a hard enough time writing the
formulas in ASCII. :-)

Kudos to Stephan for taking the trouble to write the formulas in ASCII so
that they are accessible to a wide audience.

Though I find BiBTeX format unnatural, I don't find it inaccessible, nor to
require a code book for decipherment. Thus my personal reaction to it is
more akin to that from a writing style not my own than to a piece of
somewhat obscure jargon (as I feel TeX is to the wider readership).

Putting it another way, I can read BiBTeX as, I suspect, can every other
person with at least a Junior High School education during which he or she
paid attention. I can't say the same for much of TeX' representation of
mathematical formulae.

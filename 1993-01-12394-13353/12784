    As of 1st January 1993, there are no longer export/import restrictions
    between member states of the EC. Therefore, the movement of PGP NL/UK,
    NL/IT, NL/GE, NL/FR (or any of the 16^2 combinations possible) is no 
    longer any concern of national member states. National regulations 
    regarding the use of PGP or other strong cryptology may still exist. 

I'd be surprised if the import and export of munitions aren't still restricted,
even though regular commercial goods can now be traded more freely.
Governments tend to treat such things specially :-)
Obviously, check your local laws to see whether crypto software is a munition.

Bush's pardon of his co-conspirators shows that he is, in the end, still a wimp.

Before that time, it had not been observed that inverting exponentiation
was hard.  The fact was not known.  There was a small amount of the use
of number theory in cryptography, but only at the level of an undergraduate
course.  Were any good number-theorists actively interested?

That factoring was hard was believed, but the "square-root" methods for
factoring, although quite old, was only rediscovered and employed on a
large scale relatively recently.  This is the first sub-exponential
algorithm, to my knowledge.

It is still not known how hard factoring is; there has been a continual
improvement in the process, and if it turns out factoring is MUCH easier,
the RSA algorithm will become essentially useless.  While it may be shown
that trap-door functions exist, I am not aware of any definitely shown to
be so.

RSA were actively working on the problems of primality testing and factorization
before they came up with the algorithm.  I have read some of their papers.

The question is, what is obvious?  It depends on the person.  One of the
jokes going around around 1950 was that "obvious mod von Neumann" meant that
if you were really bright you might be able to prove the result in two weeks.
Does "skilled in the art" mean a sign-painter or an artist?  I claim it was
obvious to any artist looking at the problem.  That nobody had seen it before
is not inconsistent with that.

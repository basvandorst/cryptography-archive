Really? How nice... So, if you put some top secret information for
anonymous ftp and I happen to get it, it will be me the guilty one,
not you, right? Wanna give it a try? :-)

As usually, you are wrong. I checked with a person in BSI (the Federal
agency for Information Security in Germany). There are NO restrictions
on importing crypto software in Germany. There are NO restrictions on
using public key encryption software in Germany, although if GATT is
agreed upon, this might change (the US patent laws will apply). When I
asked him all those questions, his reaction was: "What are you speaking
about? PGP? Yeah, I got it too - nice program"...

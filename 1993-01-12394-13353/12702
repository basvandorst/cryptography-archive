How can a victim of nationalism be collegial with one who so self-
righteously endorses his nation's arbitrary interference into the
peaceful activities of unaffiliated third parties, such as non-
nationals who would trade in encryption software?  I'm afraid that
your time inside the beltway has blinded you to the fact that your
``democratically elected Congress'' institutes a tyranny of the
majority which is inconsistent with personal freedom and civility
and even with the ostensible principles of your government.

See my letter in Communications of the ACM, 1992 April, for
amplification on these points.

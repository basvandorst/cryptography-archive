Huh?  c ~= 3e8 m/s.  (The difference between c(vaccuum) and c(air) is
negligable here.)  TV signals are EM waves, so they move at c.

 3e8 m     1 s
------- * ------ = 300 m/us
  1 s     1e6 us

Therefore, TV signals travel 300m in 1 microsecond.  Assuming that the
algorithm rounds to nearest even microsecond and a worst-case distance
scenario (the TV transmitter is right next to either the base unit or
the handset, leading to maximum propagation delay), the two units can
still be up to 300m away from each other without "hearing" different
signals.  300m is likely to be much farther than the effective range
of the phone with a multi-megawatt TV transmitter next to one of the
antennas.

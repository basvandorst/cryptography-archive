Glad to hear this :-)) (i was the fool who asked Mr. Lai for chapter 3 of
his doctorate thesis and posted it, and I am sorry I did not include the
appropriate references)

The larger document is NOT available electronically, but is the doctorate
thesis of Mr. Lai. I am sure he will have nothing against sending you the
ISBN-number of this document. His mail-adress is lai@isi.ethz.ch

Are you interested in chapter five ? ;-)))) (No I have it only on paper)

Friendly greetings,

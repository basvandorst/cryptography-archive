Another case of vapour ware?
If the typewriter was manual, and the bug so well concealed as to fool x-ray 
examination, from whence came its power?

Standard searches for bugs are as follows (in order):
	1. Spectrum scan from 1Khz to at least 2Ghz, while creating an 
activity that should stimulate any bug's activity.
	2. Search with a non-linear junction detector, for those bugs which 
are buried in some other material  and will only transmit on receipt of a 
code signal, also search for bugs inert because their power source is 
depleted/failed. 
	3. Only when 1. or 2. gives a positive return and physical discovery
will necessitate expensive damage is X-ray investigation used.

Off-topic for sci.crypt, I think, but vapour ware is vapour ware where ever 
one finds it.

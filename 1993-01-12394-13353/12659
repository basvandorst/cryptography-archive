As usual, David Sternlight is breaking in in a purely technical
discussion to introduce Fear, Uncertanity and Doubt with his
incompetent comments.

It is/was more bound up with the communist party, although the
military also had a strong influence... Although, it is more exact to
say that it was the other way around - for instance, not the military
controled the schools, but the schools were organized a bit in a
military manner. To an inexperienced external observer it could indeed
look like if the military is controlling them...

Of course, the high-tech technologies had to be based on Science and
Technology. It is more than natural that SCST was used to control
them. And, as far as I know, the former USSR is not the only country
that uses the Science and Technology to produce nuclear weapons and
missils...

Which does not mean that they were all military spies, mind you. But
they were all members of the communist party - this was a
requirement.

:-)))). If he were, he wouldn't say a peep about any found
deficiencies in PGP, rest assured...

You are underestimating the level of paranoia in these circles...
Rest assured, if he were somehow connected with the people you
suspect, he wouldn't say anything publicly...

Now, I -am- an expert on computer viruses and with all my authority on
the subject I am stating that you are speaking nonsense.

No, in the paragraph quoted by you he is speaking about an ineffective
implementation. He also mentioned something about a cryptographic
weakness (like the keys being easier to factor), but that was in a
different place.

256 bits means 77-digit numbers. Hey, even I am able to factor such
thing with a workstation and a good factoring program! But, as Phil
said, PGP never uses such small keys... The smallest ones are 384-bit.

Sidelnikov expressed some doubts without backing them up with evidence
or explanations. It is more than normal to ask for proofs.

If he were, he wouldn't be publishing his results...

But it is perfectly appropriate to ask somebody to back up their
claims with evidence.

And I thought that you would not use PGP because you find it illegal,
unethical, immoral, fattening (oops, this does not belong here) and
whatnot... :-) Anyway, we need some proofs before discarding a
perfectly looking program, based on well-researched methods.

:-))))). My guess is that either the word "academician" was not used
correctly, or that Dr. Sidelnikov is presenting the results achieved
by his laboratory, not by him... I just cannot believe that an
academician will spend time playing with such things... I also find it
hard to believe that an academician is only a lab manager... Maybe the
person who forwarded the message could clear that for us?

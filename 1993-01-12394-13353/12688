Robert Cain posts another of the distortions I've grown used to from him:

Since I have no interest in ripem vs. pgp, or in RSA, and as I've
said to some I actually like the PGP interface much more, my
messages can hardly be called self-serving.

This is another of Cain's falsehoods. The issue was playing games,
MUDs, etc. at public expense, and I argued that one might question
this based on the NSF guidelines. Very few users, not "most of us"
were involved in doing that. Cain didn't much like that suggestion,
and responded with personal invective of the sort his current message
is a comparatively restrained example.

The rest of Cain's message consists mostly of personal attacks, and
i won't dignify them with a reply.

I will point out that he's one who seems to be deliberately violating
RSA's patents by offering to correspond in both PGP 1.0 and 2.0
from a site actually quite near to RSA's offices in Northern
California, and that perhaps reveals more about Cain than anything
I can say.

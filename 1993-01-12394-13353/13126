Last time sci.crypt was flooded with articles which dealt with the
legalities rather than the science of cryptography, we created new
groups for the traffic. One of the new groups was misc.legal.computing.

There's quite a bit of useful information running around sci.crypt among
all the noise. The only problem is that it doesn't belong in sci.crypt.
People---primarily post-happy sci.crypt newbies---aren't paying
attention to the (usually rather clear) distinction between legal
issues and technical issues. Why would they pay attention to the far
less important (and far less clear) distinction between ``hobbyist''
and ``research'' traffic?

I suggest that we all be careful to redirect threads when they lose
their relevance to *sci*.crypt. If misc.legal.computing is overwhelmed
then we can create misc.legal.computing.crypt.

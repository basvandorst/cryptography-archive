It now seems that we can redirect Mr. Sternlight's self-gratificatory adulation 
to where it rightfully belongs.... ALT.FAN.DAVID-STERNLIGHT! Yes, the group has 
at last, been created. Now simply begin crossposting all irrelevant drivel to
this 'other' group, and taper off these "sternlightisms" until the day that 
sci.crypt can go COLD TURKEY! How apropos! B^> B^>

Bite me. Or perhaps bite yourself, as that seems to excite you more....

I can vouch for the approach - I wrote just such a program for a class
six or seven years ago. I fed it text in English/French/Spanish/German
and let it calculate the pair/triplet/whatever (it was selectable, I
think triplets and pairs both worked well) frequencies. It worked
very well - pretty much 100% accuracy on sentence-length samples of
unknown language, unless I deliberately tried to fool it.

I don't know where the source code ended up; it was in Prolog anyway.

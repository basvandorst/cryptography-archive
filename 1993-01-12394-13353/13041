I desperately need the sci.crypt FAQ, could someone please either post it or
E-Mail it to me (tsa!cellar@tredysvr.tredydev.unisys.com).

I finally discovered, at the age of 21, what all of my friends had found out

else.  Politically Correct:  Socially, Politcally, and Environmentally
concious to the point of nausea.  tsa%cellar@tredysvr.tredydev.unisys.com

In the the dear dead days beyond recall (say, a month ago) I remember
somebody saying,"If you make it available on a bulletin board then
you've exported it".  It could have been David Sternlight - it's his
style.  (Unambiguously moral or arrogantly dogmatic - you choose).

If s/he's right then hasn't RSA violated the relevant regs. ?

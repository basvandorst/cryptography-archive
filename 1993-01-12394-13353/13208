Non-standard (to me) terminology. I would assume them to mean:

	1) Superencipherment. Double (or more) encryption. Examples would be: 
the repetitive encryption in DES of a message (by any of several methods) to 
improve the cryptographic protection available from a 56 bit key. Also the 
off-line encryption of plain text in one cipher before on-line encryption in a 
second cipher during the transmission process.

	2) Generatrix. The feminine counterpart of 'generator'. The politically
correct equivalent of The Lady's Prayer, 'Our Mother which art in Heaven.....'

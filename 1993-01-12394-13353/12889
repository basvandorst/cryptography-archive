	I don't know about you folks but I am beginning to suspect that
	Mr. Sternlight here is really an undergraduate with an active
	imagination.  I feel kind of stupid for being spoofed at this
	point.  First he worked for Nixon in the commerce department
	and now he's an author of Fortran.  Next, no doubt, his superior
	knowledge of constitutional law will be the result of his
	having authored the constitution.  ;-)

	Name drop. Name drop. Name drop.  I think you have gone a
	little too far Mr. Sternlight.  Now we are on to you.
	Nice performance though.  You spoofed alot of people for
	a long time.  It's over now though, you can come clean.
	Who are you really?

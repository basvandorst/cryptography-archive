Hi, does anyone know, or can provide any pointer in the literature to, any 
random permutation generation algorithm that can be easily implemented as a 
function in a computer program?  

Ideally, this function would be computationally effective, and the input 
that this function takes would be some kind of index/rank number of the
permution to be generated.  

But of course, I am interested in knowing *all* kinds of permutation generation 
algorithms.  

Many thanks in advance!  Best of wishes for 93.

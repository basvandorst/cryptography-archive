I have watched and crossed swords with Mr. Sternlight before in other
groups.  One thing to know about him is that in whatever group or
discussion in which he participates he manages to find the most
extreme, unpopular and self serving position he can to draw the most
flames, contoversy and attention.  He seems to me to be primarily a
net.masochist.  He argued vociferously in a local netcom group that
most of us there had no right to be on the internet because we had no
"legitimate" academic or research purposes whereas he of course did.
From the ammount of effort he puts in to it it seems that his area of
resarch is the sociology of net.confrontation.  This is just one
example, there are others.  Please consider this to reduce our noise
level before responding to or otherwise engaging his egocentricity in
the future.

I have been watching this example of his nonsense in silence because I
do not like engaging in personal or ad hominum attacks but he has
finally pissed me off sufficiently that feel I have to speak out.
While I too am a supporter and future licensee of RSA and PKP, with
friends like him they need few enemies.

On the subject of RSA and PKP, people should really find out for
themselves the facts regarding the cost and availability of licenses
from them before blindly attacking.  In my experience they are more
than reasonable.  I was astonished when I finally quit buying the net
legends and asked them.

Your shot David, but don't expect a response.

Bob

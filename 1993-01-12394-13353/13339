I made a mistake in a later step.  When I said that Bob chooses h and t
relatively prime to p, I meant to say that he chooses h and t primitive
in GF(p).  The prime factorization of p-1 serves two purposes:  it makes
it easier to find numbers primitive in GF(p), and it convinces Bob that
p-1 is not the product of a bunch of small primes (which would make the
discreet logarithm problem easier).

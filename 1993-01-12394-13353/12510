Two points.

Regulations, in this case, have the force of law unless/until they are
shown to be inconsistent with the authorizing law or otherwise illegal.

Dave, I believe, claimed that the "software" is defined in the preamble to
the regs, (or something like that).  I don't know if "crypto software" is
defined in the regs, in the law, or somewhere else entirely.  (If it's
somewhere else, the regs are probably unconstitutionally vague or do not
cover PGP).

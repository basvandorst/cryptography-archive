   What ever happened to the suggestion to split this group into sci.crypt and
   sci.crypt.research?  Has it been formally proposed yet?

An RFD was posted, but it was not submitted to the moderator of
news.announce.newgroups and so is invalid.  I am surprised there
hasn't been an attempt to try again yet.  alt.fan.david-sternlight is
perhaps a better way of splitting the group... :-)

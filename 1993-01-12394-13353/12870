Allow me.  As someone who is relatively unpartisan on the legality flamewar,
let me say as a TeX partisan (member of UK Tug committee) that you are just
plain wrong here.  TeX *is* a standard in the mathematical world, and it
is the *only* option in most of Europe because so little US-written software
except TeX copes with non-US character sets.

Now I see you talking through your arse on a subject I know something about
myself, I have to infer that perhaps you're also talking through your arse on
the subjects I don't know much about and had been willing to give you the
benefit of the doubt on so far...

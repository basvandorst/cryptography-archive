Not quite. The best rigorously proved upper bound is

exp((1+o(1) sqrt(log N log log N))

The Number Field Sieve [on some reasonable unproved assumptions] takes

exp( (c + o(1))  (log N)^1/3  (log log N)^2/3)

with c ~ 1.91

These are both sub-exponential and considerably better than O(sqrt(N)).
Even the older Pollard Rho, Squfof and FFT-based P-1 achieved 
O(N^1/4), not O(sqrt(N)).

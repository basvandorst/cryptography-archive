No. TeX was first developed in SAIL at Stanford and then rewritten in
Pascal. TeX for Unix came much later. The C port of TeX is mechanically
generated from the Pascal source --- i.e., TeX is still maintained in
Pascal.

In fact, TeX was designed to run on any computer that supported Pascal,
which back in the early 80s was just about any serious computer. So you
can find TeX on IBM mainframes, VMS machines, Unix, Mac, DOS, etc. etc.
etc.

Additionally, a Unix bigot would laugh at your suggestion that TeX is a
Unix language. The "true" Unix language for mathematical formulas is
"eqn".

Anyway, in response to your call for a different "programming language"
for expressing formulas, please tell me how to express the integral
of e to the minus x squared in FORTRAN IV. I am curious.

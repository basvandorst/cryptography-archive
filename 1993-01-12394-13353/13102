Today I called the State Department, where nobody who I knew was in.
Then I called the NSA office that coordinates with the State Department
in handling CJ requests. They said that the proposed ITAR published in
the May 1992 Federal Register was adopted very recently and is now being
printed by the Government Printing Office.

I'm inclined to agree, though I'm not thoroughly familiar with the new
regulations. Keep in mind that this is thirdhand information; you should
get the new ITARs directly from the guv'mint and check. Hope this helps.

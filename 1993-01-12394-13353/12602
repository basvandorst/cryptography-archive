Perry Metzger, who purports to be a libertarian, posts a fascist message
in which he:

1. Moves from making assertions to representing them as facts.

2. Attempts to assert that everybody but me shares his views.

3. Wraps himself in the royal "we". (I guess he's a crypto monarchist
as well).

His message speaks for itself.

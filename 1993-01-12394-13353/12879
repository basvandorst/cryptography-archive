Umm, TeX is available on Macs, PCs and more, generally for free even.
It is very widespread.

TeX is designed to be easily read and useed in typesetting it's codes
can be _very_ clear and easy to understand.  Mathematicians pass TeX
documents between each other frequently, and I find I have absolutely no
problems reading them without typesetting them except when they are
outrageously complicated.

\dots, and the difference is that \dots will show up as an ellipses
rather than three periods. Also, it seems to me you figured out what it
meant rather quickly.

I see, let's write a bunch of lines of obscure outdated Fortran code for
you when the rest of the mathematical world uses TeX.

It is true, at least for _Mathematicians_.  I use it on my Macintosh,
not on my UNIX boxes.  There is no necessary link between TeX and a UNIX
box.

The message was intended for the whole USENET to refute Sidelnikov's
unsupported claims.  And if Sidelnikov has just about _any_ computer
available to him, UNIX, VAX, PC, Macintosh, etc, he should be able to
read a TeX document.

David, we are being fair, you are the one who wants to debate piddly
point because you realize you have no firm ground to stand on so you
argue about TeX.

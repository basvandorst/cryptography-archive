1. TeX was developed by a mathematician, and its ability to display
   mathematical formulae is "often imitated, never equalled". It is
   therefore a perfectly valid way of conveying mathematical formulae
   via an electronic medium, and can convey many more mathematical
   concepts than Fortran or APL or Cobol or whatever Mr. Strenlight
   has in mind.  Get a TeX viewer.

2. TeX is freely available in source code form, and with a bit of
   ingenuity and persistence (no problem if you've lived with COCOM
   for 40 years) it can be made to run on anything from an Atari ST
   to (presumably) a Polish-built PDP11 clone. These qualities are
   much prized in the CIS. Indeed if the number of references to
   Cyrillic fonts in comp.text.tex is anything to go by, there would
   appear to be something of a TeX boom in the CIS.

In any case I don't think Herr (Doktor?) Neuhaus's remarks were addressed
so much the putative academician Dr. Sidelnikov as to us netters. I think
we may safely assume that Sidelnikov is not reading this newsgroup, or we
would have heard from him by now.

Honestly, I think some people just enjoy argument for argument's sake... :-P

In response to Christopher Browne, TeX is not a standard in the
mathematical world, though it may be in the West among Unix systems.
In particular, there's no reason to believe Sidelnikov can read TeX.
As one who has been taken to task by others for allegedly being
U.S.-centric, I'm surprised others should make this error.

Those who make this an occasion to attack me personally are simply not
taking this discussion seriously, but are being partisan.

As for what I'd prefer, as one of the authors of Fortran II and IV at
IBM in the '50s, I'd prefer Fortran. More importantly, in my many
visits to Soviet computer centers I found Fortran very widespread
there even now, and the likelihood of Sidelnikov or his people being
able to read Fortran is rather better than that they can read TeX.
Some of the centers I'm intimately familiar with include those of the
principal Science and Energy advisors to Gorbachev when he was running
things, and thus they might be typical of well-funded centers there.

I subscribed to this group hoping to learn something interesting
about cryptology.  But in the last week and a half I have seen
less than a dozen useful messages among the hundred or two I
have waded through.  I therefore propose that the name of this
group to:

   sci.ripem-ftp.Zimmermann-Sidelnikov.lets-pick-on-David-Sternlight

See ya, I'm unsubscribing...

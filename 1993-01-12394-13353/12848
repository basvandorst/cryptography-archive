I have an old AT&T 5300 cordless at home. (I think that's the # -- base no
bigger than the handset, no buttons or speaker on the base, ...).

I tried out a VTECH digital 900 MHz cordless for a while (same claims as
this new AT&T phone).

I'm in a high-rise apt building.  The 5300 outperformed the VTECH in range
of operation.  The sound quality was better, as well, except where the 5300
encountered heavy noise.  The VTECH would drop out rather than get noisy,
but that wasn't enough to get me to change -- especially not at VTECH's
$350 price or AT&T's $450.  The 5300 sells for about $100, or did when I got
it.

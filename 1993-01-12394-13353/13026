There were so many errors in your messages lately, that the only way
to deal with them is to point them out, one by one. Otherwise, one
should quote you whole message and add a single word beneath it:
"NONSENSE", but this is not very informative...

First, TeX -is- a language for general communication of mathematical
formulas (and many other things that do not fit in the 7-bit ASCII
charset). Second, the article was aimed toward some people with some
minimal skills in the field. And those withouth these skills? (Or
maybe I should say "And the one without these skills?") Well, the
message was not for them (him?), they (he?) will not understand it
anyway, so in TeX, Fortran, Basic, or Greek it doesn't matter
anyway... :-)

Ah, so you are already so sure about it? But, Mr. Sternlight, may I
remind you that just two postings ago you wrote:

So what, actually, is your point? Do you have any idea what you are
talking about at all? Or you want to prove yet another time to the
world that not only are you unable to read other people's messages,
but you are also unable to read the messages of your own...

FYI, neither of the flashy GUIs in the environments mentioned by you
is able to do the kind of powerful things available to TeX. Only
NeXT's PostScript display comes to something close, but even there you
don't have the power of control as in TeX, where with e few commands
you can change the entire look of the page...

NONSENSE! (No, couldn't resist!) If something's yesterday's
technology, this is the Lisa mentioned above... Gosh, are there still
people around using them?

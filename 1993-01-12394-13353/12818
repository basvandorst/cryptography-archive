 As some may have noticed, I don't type particularly well or fast (I thought), 
 using two fingers and a thumb. However, several times, when experimenting 
 with PGP2.1 key construction, I have received screen messages requiring me 
 to add to the character stream as some earlier characters had been typed in 
 too fast. I understand this to mean that the time interval from one 
 character to the next was too small for the key generation program (under DOS)
 to use. Though noting the occurences, until Rob's post, I did not give them
 much further thought. 
 
 Does anyone know what the limits on the time interval measurement are and 
 what effect this will have on the random number vectors?

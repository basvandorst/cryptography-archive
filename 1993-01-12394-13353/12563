Is there any Millatry based Cordless phones like the DUOFONE E499.  Is it a
HAM Radio based PHONE that has virtually untracible or fixed signal.  I am
curious if there are phones or Hand radios available at a inexpensive price
for example $300 up or are they allot cheaper now.

Just more Curious then anything does it work with voice and data support and
could I patch a Satillite signal to it.  I might know some people who are
intrested.

Thanks

Zandor

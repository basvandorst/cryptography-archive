Check out "Random Number Generators: Good Ones are Hard to Find" by Steven
K. Park and Keith W. Miller, _Communications_of_the_ACM_ Volume 31 Number 10,
October 1988.

Here they define a "minimal standard" RNG that is implemented several
different ways (in Pascal, but it ports to C in about 1.75 minutes).  Even
if you choose to use a different RNG, it may be good for you to read this
article anyway.  It's very informative.

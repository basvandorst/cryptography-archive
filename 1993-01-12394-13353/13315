Subject: Wanted: Source code for public/private key algorithm

I am working on a micro-controller based device which is to communicate
over an arbitrary channel, and I would like to implement a public key/
private key encryption scheme for the data.

Could someone provide a pointer to any source code for both generating
the keys, as well as the algorithm for applying the keys to the
plaintext?  Is the plaintext simply XORed with a repetitive key?

Ideally, there would be some source code for three functions: 
cyphertext = encrypt(key, data)
plaintext = decrypt(key, data)
publickey = generatekey(seed, &privatekey)

I hope what I'm asking for is not childishly trivial; I'm assuming that
more than a few lines of code is required.

Thanks for any help.

 I think it is easy to show that no protocol whatsoever can possibly
 detect spoofing unless we can be certain who is on the far end:

      The party on the other end may be the spoofer himself; if we
      cannot detect this, even a protocol which absolutely assures
      a secure channel cannot possibly protect us from spoofing.

In article <1993Jan23.030558.4357@netcom.com>,
in a silly attempt to show that ITAR prevents the import of PGP into the U.S.,

Yes, Sternlight. Why don't you read the law you're quoting?

ITAR covers *permanent* exports, *temporary* exports, and *temporary*
imports. *Permanent* imports are under Treasury control.

The regulations above talk about (a) *temporary* exports, under DTC,
(b) *temporary* imports, under DTC, (c) *permanent* imports, under the
Department of the Treasury.

For PGP we're talking about *permanent* imports. ITAR doesn't apply.
Treasury Department regulations do.

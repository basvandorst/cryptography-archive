   To add my own two problems:
   1) The OS/2 port refuses to accept input from stdin, for stuff like "Y/N" 
   prompts this would be nice for those of us developing shells.  (I have my
   suspicions why direct keyboard input is required to create the random 
   seed(s), but for ordinary input this shouldn't be necessary.)

this is true on UNIX, too.  That is because the Y/N code opens the tty
to read the values.  I agree that there should be some way to override this.
Which particular cases are you trying to shell around?

   2) Output to a pipe does not work - PGP tries to rename the "file"
   it finds, it cannot, it prompts for a new filename.  (Simply allowing 
   an overwrite option should work wonderfully... preferably as a
   default or a command line parameter.)

What do you mean?  I've never had much problem with this.

"Someone suggested that I have "sold out to RSADS" because I have 
recommended MailSafe as the most user friendly program available for non 
programmers and engineers to use to secure their files. "

He should not be cowed by the ridiculous habit some have of
trying to discredit those who come to their own conclusions
by labelling it "selling out." This propaganda phrase from
the sixties is a nonsense, and those who use it reveal their
own inability to conduct a serious discussion.

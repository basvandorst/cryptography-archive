The above number is 209 digits. Its square root is 105 digits. Let's
say it is the product of primes, the first 10 digits of which are the
same. Thus, they are nearly equal. That only leaves about 10^95 numbers
to search by the proposal you make.

The method you suggest is known as Fermat's method. It is still
only O(sqrt(N)).

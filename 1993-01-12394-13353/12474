As far as anyone knows, there are *no* pending bills in the US
Congress to restrict the domestic use of cryptography. This whole
firestorm was started by one misguided private citizen, Dr. Dorothy
Denning, writing an article proposing a mechanism by which mandatory
cryptographic key registration could be implemented.

This is not to say, of course, that there aren't factions within the
government that would love to see Denning's proposal become law. But
that is not enough to pass or even introduce a bill in Congress.
Admiral Bobby Inman found this out a decade ago when, as Director of
the NSA, he stridently called for "born classified" controls on
academic cryptography resembling those of the Atomic Secrets Act. He
was roundly jeered and/or ignored. As Bamford said in the Puzzle
Palace, "Thus far, however, Inman's 'tidal wave' of public outrage
[over the open publication of cryptographic research] has yet to
dampen the soles of his shoes."

In other words, don't become complacent, but don't overreact either.

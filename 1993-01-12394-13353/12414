	I have a question:  for some who may use a modem to receive their
tax refunds from the Federal Government, does the Government employ 
some form of encryption/decryption utility in the delivering/sending of
sensitive information? It would seem to me they do, but I haven't spoken to
anyone who has used the modem to receive their refund(s) or other information
regarding the sensitive nature of taxes, which is private business?

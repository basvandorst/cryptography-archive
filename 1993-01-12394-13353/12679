Gripe #1:
The US is not part of the "first world".

The ordering is:

"Old World"  i.e. - Europe
"New World"  i.e. - the Americas, and generally NORTH America
"Third World" which refers to "the rest", generally dealing with
poorer/newer countries in some combination of Africa, Asia, and
sometimes South America.

North America is most certainly NOT in the "first world".

It is reasonable to believe that he was probably using a form of
hyperbole in which it is pretended that there is only one US taxpayer.
He most definitely did NOT say "the cost to each US taxpayer of
breaking each DES ciphertext is $56", which WOULD imply the $14T.

There's lots of griping about the "evil NSA," and lots of conspiracy
theories.  When someone "asks about assumptions," it is unkind (and a
waste of time) to pick holes in the question without at least TRYING
to answer what was asked.

If that $56 figure is faintly accurate, then I expect that the NSA
must have some rather high-speed hardware, probably specialized to
DES, that costs quite a bit less than anyone expected.  I would have
expected a somewhat higher bill.

I can give some basic "blanks" to fill in:

a) Number of messages processed: _____________

b) Mean Size of messages processed:   _____________  (may be important)

A * B = "total ciphertext"

c) Cost of electricity and staffing, per hour, for the NSA "DES
Breaker" computer:                  ____________

d) Average time to decrypt 1K of message on the "DES Breaker":
______________

Actually, one can probably get that $56 just out of figures b), c) and
d).

$56 = (b) * (c) / (d)

I'm ignoring capital costs, in this analysis, but I'd suspect that so
does the NSA.  Governments don't tend to consider "capital costs" to
be REAL costs, for a variety of reasons.

And if anyone wishes to publicise the values b), c) and d), that's
THEIR choice.  Those three numbers are probably considered QUITE
secret.

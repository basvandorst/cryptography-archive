For anyone interested in looking at the design of one particular
spread spectrum radio telephone system (Qualcomm CDMA), we've made
postscript copies of our Common Air Interface spec available by
anonymous FTP. The machine is lorien.qualcomm.com, and the directory
is /pub/cdma. I recommend fetching the "overview" document first, as
it is a relatively short and readable overview of the technology. The
other files comprise the formal specification, which will burn about
two reams of paper if you print them all out.

By the way, because of its military heritage, spread spectrum
technology tends to be export controlled. These files are
available for anonymous FTP as a direct result of the ITAR "public
domain" clause...i.e., by making them publicly available we avoid
any question about whether these documents are exportable, and
whether the technology can be discussed at standards meetings, etc,
where foreign nationals are present. They are, and it can.

And, as you ask, what am *I* missing here?  Radio propagation delay is 5.2
microseconds per mile....not one microsecond per three meters.  Were that
the case, we would see some interesting effects on our portable TV sets at
the baseball game.....we would be getting up to leave in real life, while
watching the final home run clear the fence on the TV!

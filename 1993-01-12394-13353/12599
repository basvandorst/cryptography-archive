In this case the software is more like the journal, the computer running
the program is more like the raw materials needed to make the gunpowder.
The government does a great deal to limit the export of high-performance
computing required to do encryption of large amounts of data.

The government does it's best to prevent encryption information from
becoming public knowledge, but after the knowledge becomes public,
the government concentrates it's efforts on preventing high-performance
(bulk) encryption hardware implementations from being exported.

The best DES routines come from Finland, anyway.  I suspect the Russians
have excellent cryptographic technology, but inadequate computer power to
allow it's widespread use.  Obviously the Russians, along with every other
country that isn't allowed to import cryptographic equipment, have fully
functional DES and RSA source code.  The whole idea of preventing the export
of such widely available source code is just plain silly.

Except that the export license clearly states that if source code is
publicly available, then then the object code is exportable.

   Unfortunately, this isn't always true.  Many of the LEAs I've dealth with
who use speech inversion thought it was 'secure,' although some individual
officers who have used CBs thought the inversion was single sideband.  It is
not uncommon for some agencies to still have the belief that the 'Private
Line' ('PL') setting on their radios will scramble the communications.

   *Transcrypt* has a lot of nice systems which they've sold to everyone
from the newsmedia to the National Guard & even some foreign military sales.
I think you referenced their 'Stealth' product, which is a slow, direct-sequence
analog audio system using a variable hop-rate (max of ~50/sec) system.

 
     I disagree with your asserting that most LEA SWAT, narcotics, or other
'high-risk' units use digital voice -- let alone ANY -- voice privacy
systems.  I wish it were the case...

	 Read "Turing - The Enigma" for a biography of Turing and a general
   discussion of life and work at Bletchley Park.  "Ultra Goes to War"
   and "The Ultra Secret" discuss the military implications.  If you can
   find it, "Modern Machine Cryptography" describes exactly how the work
   at Bletchley Park was done, with photos of the gear and BASIC programs
   so you can simulate a bombe.  I've heard that a bombe has been shown
   at the Smithsonian (it may be in storage at the moment; they have far
   more stuff than museum space).

Also check out the new book "The Ultra-Magic Deals and the Most
Secret Special Relationship, 1940-1946" by Bradley F. Smith.
It's about the US-UK cooperation and its postwar implications.
I just got this book, haven't read it yet but it looks quite good.

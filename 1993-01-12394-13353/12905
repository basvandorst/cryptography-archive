That's only because you don't know how freely available is TeX there.
Believe me, it is. The only limitation factor is the huge amount of
disk space it occupies... :-)

:-))). FORTRAN might have been popular in the '50s. It might be
popular even now - mainly among engineers and physicists - because
there is already a huge amount of software written in FORTRAN for
them. But most matematicians and computer scientists consider it a
dinosaur and definitively do not prefer it for typesetting... :-)

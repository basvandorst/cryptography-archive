To add my own two problems:
1) The OS/2 port refuses to accept input from stdin, for stuff like "Y/N" 
prompts this would be nice for those of us developing shells.  (I have my
suspicions why direct keyboard input is required to create the random seed(s),
but for ordinary input this shouldn't be necessary.)

2) Output to a pipe does not work - PGP tries to rename the "file" it finds, 
when it cannot, it prompts for a new filename.  (Simply allowing an overwrite
option should work wonderfully... preferably as a default or a command line
parameter.)

Thanx,
Don

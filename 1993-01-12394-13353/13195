The antecedent of the pronoun "they" is unclear to me. To whom do
you refer? And what is "it"? Derived the asymptotic run time? Or
are you asking how the algorithm works?
 
I gave a reference in the bibliography I just posted. The paper 
assumes quite a lot of background in algebraic number theory and
knowledge of the quadratic sieve [they do not explain sieving
procedures]. It also assumes you know a lot of general techniques
in computational number theory, e.g. the Cantor-Zassenhaus method
for factoring polynomials modulo primes, etc. etc. It is a really
excellent paper, but novices will have a rough time with it.

It occurred to me when reading this post that perhaps one shouldn't be
so quick to obligingly decrypt any old thing someone puts up
fo attack. ABSOLUTELY NOT suggesting that this is the case here,
but someone wishing to obtain someone else's private info may
obtain the unwitting assistance of net experts in doing so.

In some cases it might even be illegal. Just a thought.

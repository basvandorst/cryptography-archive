Just to clear up our miscommunication here, I agree that it is
relatively easy to spoof any single channel, but somewhat harder to
spoof many channels at once. I phrased my para, above, badly.

Consider my own situation; I'm in Yorktown at IBM Research at the
moment, but my mail still goes to Melbourne Australia, and I read it
"there". This news article comes out of T.J. Watson via a completely
different network to the one that carries my telnet session to Oz. I
believe that simultaneously spoofing both of those channels in a
consistent manner to prevent me from establishing a secure channel to
someone else like me (and I know many people who have similar (stupid :-)
working lives) is nearly infeasible.

I think that TeX was the right choice for his message.  Other people
have said much about this so I will not labour the point.

Here's most of the TeX you need to know to understand that message.
I will make some oversimplifications, so TeX pedants should probably
look the other way.

The backslash character introduces special functions of many kinds.
Sometimes the meaning is not important to understanding the text;  For
example, \quad and \qquad produce varying amounts of vertical space, and
\hbox makes something that TeX internally calls a horizontal box.
Sometimes the meaning can be inferred quite easily;  For example, \sum
represent a summation symbol, \le is a less-than-or-equal symbol, \pm is
a plus-or-minus symbol, \cdot is a dot raised to the centre of the line
instead of being at the bottom of the line, \sl says that the following
text should be printed in a slanted font, \noindent says that this line
should not be indented, \sigma and \mu are lowercase Greek letters, etc.

The curly brace characters, { and } are used for grouping but are not
intended to be printed.  To print one of these, it is necessary to
precede it with a backslash, like this: \{\}.

$ stuff $ says that ``stuff'' must be processed in maths mode instead of
in text mode.  $$ stuff $$ means much the same, but is used for larger
chunks of mathematics.

In maths mode, the following apply:

    a^b and a_b are used for superscripts and subscripts.

    \bigl( and \bigr) produce left and right parentheses of a larger
    size than normal.  \Bigl and \Bigr are larger still.

    Vulgar fractions are constructed using {a \over b}.

    \sqrt{stuff} produces a square-root symbol of the right size to
    cover the ``stuff''.

I hope this helps.

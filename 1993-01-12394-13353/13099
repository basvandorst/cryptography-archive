Uh - sorry for giving two contradictive follow-ups to the same post,
but I gues it must be ...

After thinking a bit more about my first posting, and finding it's flaws
I have to agree: Two people which have never met before, and *want*
to communicate, and have only 'spoofed' channels available, and will not
meet in future over unspoofed channels have no chance to communicate 
together. 
In other words: You never can know to whom you talk!
Just assume the spoofer never let's you really communicate with the
other end, but just replies instead of it.
Now I would like to see real_world - examples where there is only one
channel or where the spoofer is granted in success... Do they exist ?

	I have another interesting if somewhat paranoid question:
		How do we know that Mr. Sidelnikov is who he says
		he is?  How do we know that we are not the victims
		of a spoof?  It is quite possible to make net postings
		look like they came from anywhere.  Does anyone have

	You could have saved yourself (or the taxpayers ;-)) some
	money getting this info.  You could have asked almost anyone
	who had been a journalist there or had taken any Soviet 
	Studies courses.  I thought this was rather widely known
	in the west.

	IF he is indeed who he APPEARS to be.

	How do your REALLY know this?

	Welcome to the internet Mr. Sidelnikov how do you like freedom?
	It can be rather painful huh? ;-)

	Nobody is immortal Dave, not even you. ;-)  Look we got this
	nonsense before about Prof. Denning from Georgetown.  The nice 
	thing about the net is that it is NOT a respecter of persons.
	We are all equal here, unlike the non-cyber world.  Mr. Sidelnikov
	will have to adjust to the rigors of absolute freedom.  I'm
	sure he'll do quite nicely David without your "protection".

	I would like to take this opportunity to extend a friendly
	"howdy" to Mr. Sidelnikov (whoever he may be) and welcome
	him to the internet where even the "immortal" can be flamed.

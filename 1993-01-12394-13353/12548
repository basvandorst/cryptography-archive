Since some have noticed that RIPEM is up on rsa.com for downloading, and
have incorrectly inferred it is now available without condition,
the following may be useful. Prior to being able to download it,
one must read the license.

After reading the license, one sees the following:
If you acknowledge that:

     1. You have read the RSAREF Program License Agreement and
        understand and agree to be bound by its terms and conditions,
        including without limitation its restrictions on foreign
        reshipment of the Program and information related to the
        Program;

     2. The computer to which you are requesting that the program be
        transmitted is located in the United States of America;

     3. You are a United States citizen or a permanent resident of the
        United States; and

     4. The RSAREF Program License Agreement is the complete and
        exclusive agreement between RSA Laboratories and you relating
        to the Program, and supersedes any proposal or prior
        agreement, oral or written, and any other communications
        between RSA Laboratories and you relating to the Program,
 then
-----------------
followed by instructions for obtaining the program.

According to the announcement, it is available to U.S. Sites only,
so presumably there is also some access control mechanism to enforce
that.

In response to Bob Heuman, I am coming around to the pragmatic view
that since the violation of U.S. law is exporting controlled material,
the violator is the person who downloaded it, not the person who
put it on a bulletin board. I'm uncomfortable with this, for obvious
reasons, but never mind.

If so, and if the downloader is outside the U.S., he is likely
outside the reach of U.S. law, and pragmatically speaking, unless
U.S. authorities want to go around taking names and putting them
on lists for visa applicant checking, or research funding, there's
little the U.S. government can do.

We next come to the point of whether the act is a violation of the
national laws in the country where the downloader is. From what
responses I've seen so far to that inquiry, it probably is in France,
Germany, maybe Italy, Canada, and the U.K., not the Netherlands, and not
Finland.  I'd like more hard information on this point, though, from
those who can quote the national laws directly.

That's where my understanding is as of today.

At last, I get to leap into the flame war on my own territory.
You are mistaken.

Digression: How does one emphasise the absolute finality of
            such a statement in a posting like this?
            Perhaps I should write
            YOU ARE MISTAKEN.
            ...or even...
            \font\bigfont=cminch scaled\magstep5
            {\bigfont YOU ARE MISTAKEN}

TeX is a typesetting language and runs under many operating systems.
TeX certainly runs under MSDOS on PCs, on Macintoshes and under VMS.
A quick look at archie also shows versions for OS/2 and Amiga.
There may well be other versions available too.
TeX also runs under Unix.

Leaving aside the actual typesetting of mathematics (for which
TeX has indeed become a standard) TeX is also the de facto standard
for communicating mathematics using ASCII text precisely because it
is writable in ASCII. In email communications with other
mathematicians, `pseudo-TeX' is often used where math-mode `$'
markers are omitted and functions are rendered by
f : A ---> B rather than $f : A \to B$, for example.
One of the tell-tale signs of a non-mathematical poster posting
about mathematics is an artistic attempt to render something like
a summation sign with five or six lines of dashes, slashes and
backslashes instead of writing \sum_{i=0}^\infty.
If one expected ones readers to have to think hard about the 
post, one may well write (sections of) the post in strict TeX
such as $\sum_{i=0}^\infty a_i x^i \in k[[x]]$. This is still
eminently readable and has the advantage that the serious
mathematical reader can run it through TeX, print it off  and
study it in more reasonable surroundings: away from the terminal,
surrounded by scrap paper, over coffee with colleagues or
wherever.

You are correct in saying that TeX was not designed to be read.
However, it is one of the few ways of writing down any real
mathematics in ASCII and it is heavily used because of that.

In private email messages, I would use and expect to see `...'
If the author wanted sections of the message to run nicely
through TeX, I  would not be surprised to see \dots. Even if
I didn't know enough TeX to understand that TeX will output
more nicely spaced dots if given \dots, I would *still* understand
what it meant.

This is incorrect.
It is more likely that a given mathematician will be able to
decipher maths from TeX than from any computing language.

In any branch of maths, if one needs to use notation that
cannot be represented easily with ASCII, then one is highly
likely to use something like TeX to represent it.
Immersion in Unix is irrelevant to the issue. In the real world
of mathematics (and, to a lesser degree, sciences and even other
areas of academia), TeX is the standard way of communicating
non-ASCII notation in ASCII in an understandable way.

The fact that TeX is completely orthogonal to Unix really
does sink this argument rather effectively, doesn't it?

So would a little knowledge of ones subject matter.

I remember reading a few years back, I believe it was in Popular
Communications, in an article written by Alice Brannigan, about an early
patent application for spread spectrum.  It was back in the early days
of radio when a Hollywood Actress came up with a way to have a radio
transmission (mainly for military applications) hop from one frequency
to another while staying in sync.

I went back over several old issues of PopCom trying to find the article
but I have had no success as of yet.  

I wonder if perhaps Heddi Lamar knows that ATT is trying to claim her patent.
;-)
As far as a patent,  The idea of spread spectrum/frequency hopping might be
considered common knowledge.  The valuable parts that might be issued such
a patent would be just what Russ asks about, the logic behind the hopping.

I can think of a few possible ways this might be achieved.  Most of them
would rely upon a main channel to which the base or remote unit would get it's
original `sync' signal.  The frequencies could be hardcoded into the ROMs of
the units, along with sequence/order or could be selected from a pool of 
available frequencies through the use of an algorithm unique to that
particular telephone set.  It could be decided by only one piece of the set
which would update the other piece when it is docked for a power recharge.

The sync signal, once the units are operating in tandem, would not be that
difficult to maintain.  One unit could use the other unit's transmission as
a reference for the sync, using one of many possible components available
in the signal. (carrier frequency, subaudible tone, or other signal)

I doubt if ATT would release their exact method of keeping their
system in sync, since that, along with their digital encoding would 
probably be what their patent(s) would cover.  You could probably get 
some idea of the methods used (to a very small extent) by looking through
the user manual and searching for such subtle hints as "the unit regenerates
it's security coding whenever it is mated with the charger" or something to
that effect.

          I'd rather get my cable service from the phone company,
                than my phone service from the cable company.

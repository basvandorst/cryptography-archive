I've been reading various texts on cryptology recently and am
somewhat dispirited. DES seems to be reasonably secure, but
does not enjoy the advantages of a public key cipher with respect
to keeping two devices independant of each other. However, there
doesn't seem to be a public key cipher (or at least I haven't read
of one yet) which is secure or computationally acceptable. Of the
techniques I have examined, the RSA cipher appears to be the best
at the moment. However, it is fairly expensive computationally.
Secondly, find many large primes for a system with possibly thousands
(or more) of devices would be akward. Thirdly, the choice of two
primes p and q is limited since certain conditions must be kept
to ensure that a high degree of message coverage is achieved (i.e.
% of messages not left as plaintext after encryption).

So, am I missing something? Definitely after a public key cipher
system since am considering a highly insecure communications network.
Authentication/digital signatures obviously useful for this.

Hope someone can help - many thanks

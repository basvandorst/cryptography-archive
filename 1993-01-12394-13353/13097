I do recall that in catching up on the last two months of sci.crypt,
I saw one comment by David Sternlight which simultaneously struck me
as being (1) correct, and (2) contrary to a popular myth about the law.
I don't recall what the comment was, though it was probably something
like ``imports are controlled by the government.''

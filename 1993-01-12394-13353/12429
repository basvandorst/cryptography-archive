In general this can have consequences other than a Joan of Arc trial,
which some seem to have in mind. The Government has many ways to
make people do what it wants. A simple example: in California
one must give one's Social Security Number to get a driver's license.
No SSN, no license. One can always spend a lot of money on attorney's
fees to sue the State, but likely to little avail and in any case
at a cost of time and money better used elsewhere.

Thus if one objects to the notion that the government might pass
a registration law, the time to object is in advance, and to one's
legislators, and not via brave talk about prying keys from one's
cold, dead hand.

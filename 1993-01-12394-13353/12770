No, you have to say:
Such a replacement for the SR-71 does NOT exist.  IF is existed it's name
would probably be Aurora, it would probably use a pulse ramjet engine that
would leave telltale diamond contrails, and it would make a lot of noise
with sonic booms.  But those are just funny clouds and earthquakes.  Pay no
attention to the man behind the curtain.  After all, the SR-71 didn't exist,
either [until Lyndon Johnson renamed the YF-12].

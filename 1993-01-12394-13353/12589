After personal communication with David I think I'll say just the following:

I offer no apology.

What I posted was publically available information which can be obtained
anonymous ftp from any site on the internet.

In fact, I wasn't even the first person to post it.
(Message-ID: <1ig1k1INNhe0@flash.pax.tpa.com.au> in alt.security.pgp
and <1993Jan6.112659.16343@bernina.ethz.ch> in sci.crypt)

The cat's out of the bag folks. If you want U.S. only distribution, you'll
need to implement some sort of access controls on the ftp server.

Enough said.

Mark

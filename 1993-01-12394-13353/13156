You need single-chip search engines (custom-built IC, not standard 
DES chips) with a gate delay of 3 nanoseconds to get a 1-microsecond
search time.  You make a machine with 100 racks of 10,000 IC's/rack.

in 1976, given economies of scale, each IC would cost ~$10 
($10M/machine).  Allow a factor of two, for other hardware and you
pay $20M/machine.  Amortize costs over 5 years, and you pay $10K/day.

10**6 keys     10**5 sec     10**6 IC     10**17 keys
----------  X  ---------  X  --------  =  -----------
  sec/IC          day           1             day

10**17 searches ~= 2**56 searches = 1 exhaustive search.

1 exhaustive search/day at $10K/day = $10K/exhaustive search.

These are 1976 figures.  Even if we are optimistic by an order
of magnitude, the cost of computation falls in 5 years by a factor 
of 10; in 15 years (by now) by 1,000.  This results in a cost of
~$10/exhaustive search.

Hellman of Stanford University at the RSA Data Security Conference,

We were talking about what's possible. Phil should read the munitions
act some day. There are some things, for example, which can readily
be seen from "unclassified territory" that are a violation of the
law to photograph. They are enumerated by general category in the 
Act.

Phil seems to think that calling attention to the facts makes one
a right-wing Republican. He is way off base.

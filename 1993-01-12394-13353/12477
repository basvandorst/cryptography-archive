Has anyone thought to call their local TV station or a local newspaper that
publishes VCR+ codes?

I would imagine the manufacturer doesn't care a fig if the algorithm is
published.  They would only care to license the production of the _hardware_
in actual VCRs.  It would be in their interest, I would think, to _give away_
the encoding algorithm to TV stations and any producer of TV listings, such
as a newspaper.  Perhaps later on, they will try & get revenue out of the
guides, but at first they surely gave it away and still may be doing so. . .

I could be wrong, but for those who care, a phone call or two ought to
do it if my guess is correct.

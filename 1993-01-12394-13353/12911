The answer is that in serious spread spectrum systems, you do your own
synchronization. It's not particularly hard to do in VLSI. The mobiles
in our CDMA system include an ASIC with three spread spectrum data
demodulators, plus a fourth dedicated to continuously searching the
entire PN sequence space (32768 chips) for correlation peaks. The main
CPU looks at the output from the searcher and assigns the demodulator
"fingers" to the three strongest components. Once assigned, the
fingers maintain lock on their own. I'm not sure of the specific
algorithm used to maintain lock, but there are several standard
techniques in the literature, the "delay locked loop" being one of
them. Basically it's a phase locked loop with a phase detector that's
sensitive to small timing offsets.

Frequency hopping is more intuitive than DS, but neither is especially
complicated in principle. In FH, you use a conventional narrowband
modem but drive the carrier frequency synthesizer with the
pseudorandom sequence.  In DS, the carrier frequency remains constant
and you multiply (XOR) the data stream with the high speed
pseudorandom chipping sequence. This spreads the signal out to a
bandwidth corresponding to the speed of the chipping sequence. In our
system, the chip rate is 1.2288 Mhz, so this is also the spreading
bandwidth.

The receiver generates the same chipping sequence and multiplies it by
the incoming spread signal. This undoes the multiply at the
transmitter, "collapsing" the signal back down to its original
narrowband form.  Then it is filtered and demodulated.

The major advantage of DS over FH is the ability to use coherent
demodulation, which picks up 3 dB in performance.

Because the pseudorandom spreading sequences are all generated by
linear feedback shift registers, this system is *not*
cryptographically secure. If you want security, you still have to
encrypt the data.  Unfortunately, we don't (long political story
here.)

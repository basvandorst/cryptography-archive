 I believe that there are two major systems are based as  foolows:
 
 In one, all transceivers for a given net are synchronised at regular 
 intervals with an atomic clock standard. Hopping then proceeds, regulated 
 by the precise time and by a pre-set code for generation of a pseudo-random 
 sequences. In this system, each transceiver is truly independent and no 
 synchronization info has to pass between transceivers. 
 In the second system, a regularly changing channel is permanently 'guarded'
 by each receiver on net. Any transceiver joining a hopper net starts with
 transmission on this channel. Each burst of information is then divided 
 between information of direct concern to the recipient and an 'overhead'
 part that instructs the receiving station(s) which channel to hop to next.
 In this system, the pseudo-random hop sequence is determined by the 
 transmitting station alone. Less efficient transmissions but without the 
 encumbrance of super accurate time standards.

Thanks for the confirmation. That is one-third of RSA and thus does
not change my surprise that Amanda would suggest America is not
still dominant in this field.

This is making too much heavy weather of my inquiry, for what purpose
I do not understand. The statement which I questioned wasn't that no
non-Americans had contributed; it was that the assumption of American
dominance was no longer warranted. I find this puzzling given the
work I'm familiar with, and what has seeped under the door about the
NSA's budget and quality of their personnel.

Phil follows this by a discussion of others' ability to copy software or
develop software from algorithms. That point is not at issue here.

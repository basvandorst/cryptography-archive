      Read "Turing - The Enigma" for a biography of Turing and a general
discussion of life and work at Bletchley Park.  "Ultra Goes to War"
and "The Ultra Secret" discuss the military implications.  If you can
find it, "Modern Machine Cryptography" describes exactly how the work
at Bletchley Park was done, with photos of the gear and BASIC programs
so you can simulate a bombe.  I've heard that a bombe has been shown
at the Smithsonian (it may be in storage at the moment; they have far
more stuff than museum space).

      There's a movie deal in this somewhere.

ps:   No, I'm not going to look up the authors and publishers for people.

    You don't have to collect published codes, you can just sit down with the
    VCR Plus+ device and start punching in numbers.  But there are 9,999,999
    7 digit codes (and each one requires 9 button presses to test), so it can
    take a long time to get enough numbers.

What does pushing buttons on the device tell you?  Doesn't pushing
a number like 1952037 cause the device to send some infrared pulses
at a particular time which is difficult to predict from the number
alone?  Or does the device somehow display what is going to send and
when it is going to send them?

Note: I don't own a VCR+, or a VCR, or even a TV set so I'm asking
from curiosity only (I think it's an interesting problem).  But
this should explain why I'm not familiar with using the device.

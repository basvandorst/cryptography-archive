	Oh, what's a couple of orders of magnitude anyway?
	Regardless, the problem still exists for reasonable distances 
	doesn't it?  How do you get around the  problem of the spatial 
	dependence of the synchronization (in the case of using a
	TV signal)? 

	By the way, what is the difference between direct sequence
	and freq. hopping?

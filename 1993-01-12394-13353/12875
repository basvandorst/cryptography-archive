Absolutely; but we foxes are keen on fresh meat :-)

I have no quibble with this, since it contains no ethical component; you
do not say that the ITAR stands on good ethical grounds, or that it is
ethically wrong to broach it or encourage its broach.  Nobody's obliged
to put themselves at risk by using PGP.

I suppose I should clarify what I said: is there anyone who takes any
part of his ethical position on PGP and ITAR?

   I'm a bit of a cryptography newbie, so I'm sorry if this questions has been
   asked before, but does anyone know of a list of the known prime numbers they
   could e-mail me or that I could ftp from somewhere?

   Any info would be appreciated.

All odd numbers are prime: 3 is prime, 5 is prime, 7 is prime, 
9 is experimental error, 11 is prime, 13 is prime...

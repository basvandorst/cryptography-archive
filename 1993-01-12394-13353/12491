Some time ago I use GWBASIC then used QB 4.0

Some of the programs were protected (save"x",p)
But to unprotect them I used a trick.
I had two files:

protect.bas and unpro.bas

protect.bas was the original program
and unpro was a file with two bytes (unpro.bas is at home
I am writing this at school )

loaded gwbasic
load"protect
load"unpro
list
10 ..
20 ....
30 ....
etc.

Isn't this easier ???

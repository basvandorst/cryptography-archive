Actually, the speed of light is about 300 meters per microsecond.

A much better way to synchronize clocks that does take different
locations into account is to use GPS. Most new receivers, even the
cheap ones, provide 1PPS (pulse per second) outputs synchronized with
UTC that can synchronize whatever external equipment you have. We use
them in our CDMA (spread spectrum) digital cellular system to
synchronize the spreading codes among cell sites. We don't do this in
lieu of building synchronizers in our receivers; we design our own
VLSI chips so the complexity of synchronization isn't a problem. We
synchronize cells to facilitate "soft handoff", where a mobile can
combine signals from two or more cells carrying the same data just
as though they were multipath components from a single cell. With GPS
it's not hard to synchronize clocks to a microsecond.

By the way, we use direct sequence, not frequency hopping.

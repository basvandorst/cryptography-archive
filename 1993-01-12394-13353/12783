A ``nation'' is an association of people.  The ``border'' of which you
write is between members and non-members, and has nothing to do with
territory or geography.  Some of those members may claim that the
nation has jurisdiction over some geographical territory, but that's
just a claim.  A person who does not consent to join the nation is not
entitled to the benefits of membership and is not responsible for the
obligations of membership.  Such a person is a non-national and is
outside the U.S. and all other nations.  A ``non-national within our
borders'' is any oxymoron.

Hi,

I don't known if this is the right group, and may be it is a FAQ, but...
I'm looking for a good way to calculate CRC-16 and CRC-32 for use in an
XModem and YModem implementation. I know it is supposed to multiply
the data string by X^16 and divide it by X^15+...+1. But i don't really
understand what it means... Could so send me either an algo or a C source
(even an 80x86 source would be appreciated) at rol@grasp1.univ-lyon1.fr ?

Once again, if it is not the right group, please don't flame me, and just
ignore this post !
THANKS !!!

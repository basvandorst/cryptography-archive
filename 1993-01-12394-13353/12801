Yes, I understand that - it is mentioned in the documentation. But,
first, the export restrictions didn't stop anyone from exporting PKZIP
(hey, they even don't have the version without encryption in USSR and
Bulgaria), second, it seems that PKWare has obtained license to export
their program to almost any country (except a few from a restricted
list), and third, the encryption code for Info-ZIP is freely available
on the ftp sites... This algorithm might not be strong enough from the
cryptographic point of view (I have yet to see a serious cryptanalysis
of it), but it is at least not as trivial to break as the algorithm
used in ARJ...

OK, maybe this discussion belongs to sci.crypt...

Now, who has acted against the ITAR. Me, as supposedly doing the 3 operations 
mentioned above, or rsa.com, giving me uncontrolled access to software which
seems to be covered by the ITAR ? Sorry for rising this political question in
sci.crypt, but I am really wondering about this. Note that I supposedly did 
this from Europe. And note too, that I supposedly did not read the README in 
rsaref/dist which contains license agreements and restrictions.

Anybody following up to this please take care to note, that even if I 
would supposedly get rsaref/ripem, i would not use it, so don't discuss
my supposed morality or ethic.

Friendly greetings,

Well, if you have an earlier version of PGP that you trust, someone
can digtially sign the new version and you can trust it if the
signature corresponds to someone you trust.

Admittedly this does not solve the bootstrap problem, but then again
nothing does. How do you know that ANYONE is trustworthy? How do you
know your wife isn't poisoning you, for example?

Yes they do, they make the US look silly, and cause trouble for the rest
of us who need to appear to be doing the correct thing.

We run Kerberos here, or to be more accurate eBones. I would like to be
able to put up version 5 of the protocol, but can not. We have the source
NFS mounted from some sites in the states, but are not allowed to look at
it! Naturally we respect the wishes of the folks at MIT who clearly do
not wish us to see them as they have no wish to get hassle from the legal
authorities in the states.

I think that people would be better served if they remembered that
anonymous FTP is a privilege, rather than a right, and that you should
abide by the wishes of the provider of the service, assuming that you
are aware of them.

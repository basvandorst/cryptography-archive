Stephan Neuhaus posts a message with content in "tex" mode. As one
unused to tex I find it near-unreadable, thought I understand what
he's trying to say. What makes him think the message will be any
more readable to Sidelnikov than Sidelnikov's is to him?

Without meaning to cast any disrespect on Neuhaus, I give this message
my vote for nerd message of the year. If one is interested in clear
communication, there must be a better way. There are several
programming languages which are near-universal, and have much more
readily understandable ways to express mathematical formulas
which read almost as easily as English.

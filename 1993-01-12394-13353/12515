You are correct that it is legal to monitor cordless phones in the US.
You may not disclose what you hear or use it for gain, which is true
of most things that you can legally monitor in the US.

However, it is not legal to even monitor cellular phone calls.  The
cellular phone people asked for and received a special rule for
cellular phones.  Older scanners picked up the 800 MHz band.  I've
heard rumors that some newer scanners can be easily modified (by
removing a jumper or something) to again receive the 800 MHz band.

This is of course still true.

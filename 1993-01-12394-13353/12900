Peter Honeyman, like several others, takes parts of my message out of
context to comment on some errors irrelevant to the substance of my
point. I was not discussing TeX as a typesetting language, but as a
language for general communication of particular mathematical formulas
in an informal mail or post message to someone whose computer
credentials are unknown.

I'm sure Tex is a wonderful and widely used language for preparing
articles and books. I'm sure it can be used to communicate formulas
unambiguously to some else known to be fluent in reading TeX. That's
not what my point was about.

By the way, though it's a separate subject, one can make the case that
TeX is an elegant way to overcome the limitations of preparing
formatted text and formulas on a character-based terminal. Some of us
have moved beyond that some time ago, to Star, Lisa, Macintosh, and
perhaps Windows technologies where ther are much simpler and more
direct ways to do the job which have the additional advantage of
WYSIWYG display. Putting it another way, and speaking only of TeX as
a language for typesetting, perhaps it's yesterday's technology, not
today's, much less tomorrow's. Responses to this paragraph by starting
a new topic in another newsgroup, please.

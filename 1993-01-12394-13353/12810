A few years ago on a television program (NOVA, I think) I saw something
like this. Some people at the Jet Propulion Lab took a couple of digitized
satellite pictures, crunched them in a computer for a while, and ended up
with a 3D model of the subject area (San Francisco, I think) in their
computer.

They could "fly" around the city (between building, etc) and view
objects from different perspectives. I don't think the were increasing
the resolution, but they were extracting the 3rd dimension information
from 2D images.

It's not the computer's clock which is the issue, although some machines
have notoriously bad clocks.

The card has a clock which can drift and the card can be subject to extremes
in temperature and shock.

Re-sync algorithms are assumed and I believe they're good.  For example,
my HP-41C has a time module with an inexpensive clock but a drift adjustment
and now that it's learned to adjust for drift, it keeps good time.  I'd expect
the card in my pocket to drift but keep sync'd once the system learns how
it drifts.

Hmmm.  Sounds like an invitation for the hens to come out and play with
the foxes!  :-)

I, for one, have chosen not to use PGP for email communication through
the computers that provide my Internet access.  I use RIPEM because there
are *no questions* in MY mind about the legality of my doing so.

I can speak only for myself.  I make no judgments about the ethical or
legal positions of others with respect to this issue.  This is the choice
I have made.  You may think I am "caving in," but my Internet access is
a privilege provided by my employer, the United States Government, and I
have little desire to risk a reprimand (or the loss of this privilege)
by using software which *may* violate either patent or import/export
control laws.  The Inspector General has a habit of ignoring "reasonable"
arguments, and I'm not prepared to sacrifice my career as a test case.

If I were accessing the Internet through a channel that *I* paid for,
I would have to give more thought to this.  As an individual, and solely
for personal (non-commercial) uses, I would at least *consider* using
PGP in addition to RIPEM, especially since RIPEM doesn't (YET!) handle
binary files.  But as it stands now, for me there is no choice.  It MUST
be RIPEM.

Even if you are in a similar situation with respect to employer and the
need to maintain an income, I'd appreciate it if you resist the tempation
to tell me what choices I *should* make (theoretically).  I have only
tried to explain what motivated *me*; everyone's choice is their own.

Oh, the "you" in the above paragraph does not refer to Paul Crowley; it
is the *general* "you."

The security of PGP's key encryption alogorithm is, as it should be, only as
strong as it's key.  While an 8 byte alphanumeric password is hardly as secure
as they 1024 bit key it protects, it would keep one busy for a little while
trying to break it..

Assuming an 8 letter password, and say about 70 choices for each letter ( 26
uppercase, 26 lowercase - yes it's case sensitive - 10 for numbers + some
punctuation etc ) hmm... 70^8 is...   5.765*10^14.  So the spooks that are
tailing you would have to try that many passwords.  Judging from PGP's spew
"Pass Phrase *looks* good."  I'd guess there's some way of telling if the pass
phrase works or not without actually having to uncipher the key and then say,
see if it is the multiplicitive inverse of the public key.

(wow, all these numbers are getting me excited - let's see what else I can
figure out..)   Let's say you borrowed Mr. Diffie's million-key/sec DES
cracker and modified it for these purposes..  it would take 5.765*10^8
seconds, or about 18 years - that seems awfully secure for a simple
password... if I boo boo'd, let me know..

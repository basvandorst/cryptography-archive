As a newcomer to all of this, I too am hesitent to jump into it, but I am
really interested in learning about cryptology/public key encryption/data
secuity/etc... . I understand how many of you feel about David Sternlight,
if I had a kill file, he'd be in it, but all of you who fuel the fire just
make it worse. I'd like to see how long he would keep it up if NOONE 
responded to any of his flaming remarks. He often has good ideas, however 
when you argue (i.e. disagree) with him, he just won't shut up. Please
quit rubbing salt in all these open wounds and lets get back to discussing
PGP or PK or anything related (not including TeX.) 

I'm not trying to start a flame war. I'd just like to see the end of the 
current ones.

I for one am very interested in a way to improve keyring management. It took
me @ 4 hours on a 486/33 to add Vesselin's keyring to mine. I think it would 
have been faster to rename his to pubring.pgp and add mine (@40 keys most of
which were on Vesselin's) to his. 

Phil Zimmerman told me that "they" are working on a PGP for Windows. Does
anyone know how this effort is going? I don't have enough Windows 
programming experience to help out directly, but I'd love to be a beta
tester. One of the non PGP specific requirements should be a simple editor
where I could compose a message, encrypt/sign it, then be able to "Copy"
to the Windows paste buffer so I can then paste it into Helldiver.

Until then, I'm using Waffle 1.65 and Helldiver for my mail/news. does anyone
know of a way to "intercept" a message from Helldiver, encrypt it by parsing 
the To: line, and then pass that to rmail? Or "intercept", sign, and pass to
rmail/rnews? 

Discussion about PGP welcome. Everything else _PLEASE_ followup via E-mail. 
(This means you too David.)

Just in case anyone wishes to send me encrypted mail here are my public keys:
(I haven't quite gotten the hang of RIPEM though.)

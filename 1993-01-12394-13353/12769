I posted a request for the VCR+ formula on
comp.compression and I was steered here. Although
I believe that this is a better example of compression
(compressing d.o.w, start time, duration, and channel)
than cryptography, I would like to use the formula
as an example of one or the other for my
data communications class. Can someone help?

Whatever "academician" means, it probably doesn't mean "member of the
Soviet Academy of Sciences."  I just went to our library, and looked through
the list of members of the Soviet Academy, and there was no V.M. Sidelnikov.
This was a pretty recent list, (1991).

Unless you choose to believe that there is a "secret list" this casts
some doubt on the rest of the article.

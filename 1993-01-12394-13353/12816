I've heard about frequency hopping and spread spectrum stuff for over a
decade now.  It sounds like a great idea, but I have never bothered,
for some reason, to ask two basic questions:

1)  How does it increase range without increasing effective radiated
power?  If it's simply a matter of raising the effective
signal-to-noise ratio, how does it accomplish that?

2)  How do the transmitter and receiver agree on the hopping sequence,
and how do they synchronize?

If this is too far off-topic (and I suspect that it is), accept my
apologies and email explanations (or references, if you think I should
be doing my own research) directly to me.

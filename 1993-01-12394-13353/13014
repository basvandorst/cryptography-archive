Hi,

I am studying a new type of high speed logic and its applications in high
performance computers. I am particularly interested in applications for
"interactive supercomputing", i.e. computation of heavy jobs on line.
Not being a supercomputer user myself, I would need some input from The Net.

I would be grateful if you could tell me what kind of problems you would like
to run interactively or where you would like to use a better model with higher
resolution. References to literature where the problem or algorithm is
described would also be appreciated. Note that my request is very general.
I am not out for any particular discipline.

Please reply by email.

Thanks in advance,

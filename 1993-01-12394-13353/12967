I have been told that, what with the cold war winding down, many of
the numbers stations have stopped transmitting.

It has generally been understood that the stations are used to talk to
secret agents, and that they are encrypted with one-time pads.  
As a result, there is no attack strategy other than gaining possession
of the one-time pad.

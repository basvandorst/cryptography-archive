   IDEA is designed to use 52 key blocks, each of 16 bits.  These are taken
from the 128-bit key in a fairly straightforward way, essentially rotating the
key 25 bits to get the next 4 or 6 key blocks.  Is there a reason why PGP
couldn't simply use its strong random number source to generate all 832 key
bits directly?  If you're using an RSA modulus of 1024 or so bits, then there
should be no problem encoding this in about the same time/space as the 128-
bit key.  This seems like it would be inherently stronger, assuming the random
bits coming out of PGP are really pretty random.  (If not, then the 128-bit
key isn't too secure, either.)

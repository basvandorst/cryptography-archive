I think nic.funet.fi has a version of kerberos, if not complete then
at least without the hooks and the diffs to apply to make it complete.
But it is not the latest version - I don't think the latest version
has been distributed widely outside USA.

Perhaps now that the U.S. president has changed the export rules will
change as well and you will be able to just ftp the code without fear
of an U.S. smart bomb dropping down your chimney the next day.  I
certainly won't be holding my breath, though.

Greetings and Felicitations:

I recently came across some terms that I don't understand very well
and I was wondering if somebody out there in net land could take a
moment to enlighten me.

What does the term "superencipherment" mean ?

What exactly is a "generatrix" ?

If this stuff is in the FAQ list, let me know and I will try to
hunt it up somewhere.  Many thanks.

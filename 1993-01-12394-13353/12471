This all assumes that you have a secure means of getting your public key
to the other or an authenticated one.  Both seem equivalent in the end
to swapping a secret key to me.  This makes me question the fundamentals
of PK actually.

Certificates, shmertificates. :-)

I have yet to see anything more than endless discussion on this.

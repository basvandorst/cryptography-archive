The argument ``Encryption software is exportable because GTDA says so''
is a myth. ( <-- wonderful sentence to quote :-) ) GTDA applies only if
BXA (in the Commerce Department) has control. If DTC (in the State
Department) has control, as it does until and unless it accepts a
Commodity Jurisdiction Request for the item, then GTDA is irrelevant.

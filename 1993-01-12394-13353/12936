If you think that post was support for your position, you're fooling
yourself, and you don't understand what people on this group are trying
to tell you.  The post you mention said, roughly, "I use RIPEM because I
could get fired for using PGP."  Do you think that anyone here says that
he should use PGP anyway?

For those who came in late: there is a real, substantive disagreement
with David Sternlight and absolutely everyone else who posts to this
group.  Sternlight lends his ethical support to that part of the ITAR
that forbids export of cryptographic software, and believes that it is
practical to enforce this section.  The rest of us consider this nuts.

Is there a single person here who agrees with David Sternlight?

We really want to hear a single peep from the many, many people who've
sent him supportive email.   It just seems terribly quiet.

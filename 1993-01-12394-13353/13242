	That would be "Inside the CIA" by Ronald Kessler.

	It all goes back to the old problem: a system is only as secure
	as the people who operate it.  Anybody paranoid enough not to
	use an electric typewriter, but not careful enough to consider
	attacks on the manual typewriter isn't really thinking about
	what they're doing and whether or not their information is
	valuable enough to an opponent to make them try that sort of thing.

	And to think that they can't produce a TV set that doesn't

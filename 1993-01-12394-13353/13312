I'm not certain what he means, but I would like to be able to do the
following:

It should be possible to tell PGP to extract not only a single public
key (with its signatures), but also the public keys of all people who
have signed that particular public key, the public keys of the people
who have signed their public keys, and so on recursively. I.e., to
extract a whole "net of trust" from a public keyring. This way the
person who receives this will get as few "Unknown signator" messages
as possible.

And while I am in my "wish list" mode - it should be possible to
extract more than one public key. That is, the command

	pgp -kxa john

should extract all public keys that could be seen with the command

	pgp -kv john

just like

	pgp -kxa '*'

extracts the all public keys available in the keyring.

Regards,
Vesselin

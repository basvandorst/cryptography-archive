>>It's a chicken-and-egg problem: You can't distribute a key in a secure
manner without a prior means of secure communications, but if that
means of secure communications is cryptographic, then it requires the
prior distribution of a key.<<

Yes, but there are other possibilities. First, the two people may be able 
to FIND a secure channel, but it is inefficient, expensive, or there is 
some other reason that it can't be used often. This method can be used to 
transfer keys and then RSA used over unsecure channels from then on. 
Second, both parties can have secure channels with a third party. This 
was discussed in the documentation for PGP, where he discusses this idea 
in full.

 David, where do you get your information. As I already told you, I 
 believe the  UK has no law that specifically deals with this issue. I 
 also told you that I would ask the advice of a legal group, some of 
 whom have expert legal knowledge in the field. My first response appears 
 to have been correct.

 As of 1st January 1993, there are no longer export/import restrictions
 between member states of the EC. Therefore, the movement of PGP NL/UK,
 NL/IT, NL/GE, NL/FR (or any of the 16^2 combinations possible) is no 
 longer any concern of national member states. National regulations 
 regarding the use of PGP or other strong cryptology may still exist. 
 For the UK, there is no bar to its use of which I am aware (and I have 
 looked).
 
 In simple terms then, any of the intra-EC uploads/downloads of PGP to 
 which you alluded create no offence. Canada mustspeak for itself.

If you read that Q&A list for the Commerce regs, you'll note that it
addresses this issue directly. If somebody with access to classified
information publishes it, he's in deep doo doo whether or not he
exports it.  But once the information is out and freely available to
the US public, it's no longer restricted and can be freely exported by
anyone else because there's no longer any point in attempting to control it.

Example: several years ago, somebody with access to KH-11 spy photos
sent some pictures of a Soviet aircraft carrier under construction to
Jane's Defense Weekly. The photos were secret, and this guy ended up
going to jail. But Aviation Week then picked up and ran the same
photos, and so did William Burrows' book "Deep Black". And you didn't
hear a peep about this because the photos were already public.

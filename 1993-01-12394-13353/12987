Depends what you mean by "his ethical position."  It's clearly the
case that the majority of people who use things like PGP in areas
where such use is not lawful are not doing so out of some kind of
"civil disobedience" reasons any more than people who speed are trying
to make some kind of protest against speeding laws.  They consider the
law inconvenient and don't believe they'll be faced with
repercussions; that's all.

If you mean "is there anyone here who thinks that ITAR is good and
reasonable with regard to this issue and would fight against any
attempt to change the law," I'm not sure that even David Sternlight
himself would fit that criteria.

You can order it from Quantum Books via e-mail (yes! via e-mail)
at  quanbook@world.std.com  .  That's how I got mine.  It cost
me $60 for the hardbound edition and an extra $3 for shipping,
and you can use your credit card to order, too.

Their phone/fax numbers are 617-494-5042/617-577-7282.  I hope
this information is what you've been looking for...

Cheers,

I was reading a paper that explained the RSA algorithm
in layman's terms, and among other things it said, "An
interesting side benefit of this algorithm is that it
makes it possible for two people who do not trust each
other to play poker by telephone." I've thought about
it, and I can't for the life of me figure out HOW. The
paper did not elaborate. Can someone explain to me the
algorithm with which two mutually distrusting players can
play poker by phone (or, more simply, have a fair coin
toss)?

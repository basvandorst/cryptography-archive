I've just begun reading _THE CODEBREAKERS_ ( every bit as amazing as people
rave on about! ) and would like to appeal to the wisdom of sci.crypt.

Can any of you furnish me with an algorithm for the WWII Japanese PURPLE
cipher? C source code would be ideal, but even just the algorithm would plant
a smile on my face.

The book talks about it being a modified version of the German ENIGMA cipher,
but, unless I'm misreading parts of the book, it doesn't say HOW it's
modified.

I'll gladly follow up to the group if I get any responses.

Thanks in advance!

Marc

In the Short Wave Listner's list (SWL-L) on the internet, there has
recently been a thread about shortwave radio broadcasts (recievable
by anyone who tunes in) that have a announcer do nothing but
broadcast long sequences of numbers. No one on that list knows the
purpose of these broadcasts, though they speculate it is some sort
of code sent to "cia field agents" and the like, perhaps using a
one time pad.

Anyone in this group know anything about this (and free to
discuss it)?
Has anyone actually taken a crack at these "number broadcasts", if
not what might be a good attack strategy?

I thought you might be intersested inthis, as it has been arround a
long time and quite vexatious (and well known) in the shortwave
community.

Sincerely,

Henry Manaster

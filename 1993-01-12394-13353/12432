This doesn't directly answer your question, but I know that Inland Revenue in
NZ uses an incorrect DES implementation run in ECB mode to protect its data
(on the other hand they only want to keep out casual browsers, I don't think
it's worth the effort using some high-security system when there are 1001 other
ways to get tax information).

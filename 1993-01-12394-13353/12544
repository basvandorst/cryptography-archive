That's a good theory, but I doubt it's correct.  I've checked hundreds
of codes from many different publications and I've never found two
different codes that mapped to the same show.  Our 6 digit algorithm
produces a perfect 1 to 1 mapping of numbers to shows for all 6 digit
codes, so there's no way Gemstar could have different programs
producing different numbers.

Part of the success of the VCR Plus+ system is due to the length of
the codes being very short.  Gemstar bent over backwards to reduce
this as much as possible.  This was the key weakness in the code that
made it so easy to break.  If they allowed multiple PlusCodes to map
to the same show (so they could tell who encoded it) then it would
make the codes longer.  I doubt they did this.

Sometimes, the same show
will have different numbers because the different guides will be using
different channels (which they expect you to deal with using the channel
mapping function of the VCR Plus+).  But you can see this when you punch
in the numbers because it shows you the channel.

If you punch in two different numbers, and it seems to map to the same
show and same channel, then the difference is probably in the duration.
This has been the case every time I've found two different numbers
for the same show.  It will typically be for shows when strange
durations or start times.  On guide might use a duration of 1:50 and the
other will choose 1:55.

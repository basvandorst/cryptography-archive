Although the early claims that PKE has the capability of establishing
a secure message channel without requiring the use of a secure key-exchange
channel have since been proven false, I suggest that PKE still offers
considerable value due to its asymmetric nature.

Asymmetric encryption (AE) provides the capability to digitally sign messages 
in a way that "cannot" be forged while allowing the recipient to verify the
signature.  Since the same key-pair can also be used to exchange secure
messages with the same "individual," my key management problem is more
tractable than if I had to maintain two keys (one for secure messages, which
could be symmetric or asymmetric, & one for suthentication, which *must* be
asymmetric).  In addition, the degree & kind of protection which must be
provided for the public part of an asymmetric key is *much* more easily
provided than that which must be provided for a symmetric key.

I suggest these are non-trivial advantages.

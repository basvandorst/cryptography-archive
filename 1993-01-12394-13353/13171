I have a paper by H. Bergen and W. Caelli which details the file protection
system used in WP version 5.0 and lower, and wrote the program last night.
The paper has appeared in both s.crypt and c.o.m.apps and contains notes
on the triviality of the code. Knowing nothing about cryptography I am 
unable to do much with the changed coding scheme in the new WP 5.1.
But the encryption has changed so the methods given do not work.

Does anyone have either the new encryption method or a program that can
decrypt the new system?


For those who have some idea of the 5.0 stuff here are the main changes
I can see:

Byte 8 can be either 00 or 01, presumably a version indicator.

Bytes 12 and 13 still provide a checksum, but byte 13 can be 00 for a
non- one letter key, where before it couldn't. This gives a wrong solution
using the old algorithm.

The key is case-sensitive, but the checksum does not change, instead the
file length is basically doubled. Either case of key will decode the file.

Thanks you anyopne who can help

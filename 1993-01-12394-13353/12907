I can't quote chapter and verse, but I also believe I have seen
the following "division" of the world in more than one publication:

1.  The "West"  (ill-defined, but sometimes referred to as 
  "Overdeveloped countries" and more universally as "Developed
  Countries" and often being also called the "First World").

  "The West" sometimes includes Japan, depending on the
  context of the speaker, since it is more a statement of 
  politics and economic development than geography, though it is
  also limited to "the United States and (Western) Europe".

2.  The "East"  (in the old Cold War sense).  This is any
  country devoted to the old-style Communist type of economic
  development.  The title "second world" is much more seldom seen,
  but is seen.

3.  The Third World or the Underdeveloped World.

This first/second/third world axis has been seen (if you trust
my memory) in things as diverse as old college sociology textbooks
and Newsweek magazine.

Those who use the Old World/New World/Third World do not, so far
as I can recall, use "First" and "Second", but those who use the
cold war West/East type division do.  Or, so my ever-treacherous memory
tells me.

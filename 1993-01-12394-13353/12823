I work at a GIS (geographic information systems) laboratory where we
work with data like this.  There is a comercial package called pv wave
which does this.  One of their demos takes several satellite pictures
from different angles and combines them to get a topography for the
area.  Given that, they map a set of luma (greyscales) values to the
topo yielding a 3D model of the city.  It's impressive to see a two year
old workstation rotate a 3D model of LA in real time. :)

I'm afraid that we've wondered afar, sorry.

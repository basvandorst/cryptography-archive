RSA is patented in the U.S.  It's patent number 4,405,829.  Within the
U.S., at least, one can get a copy of any patent for $3 by writing to
the patent office.  I have no idea how one would get one from abroad.
You might want to check with the U.S. Consulate.

Btw, patents are not copyrighted; they may be reproduced freely.

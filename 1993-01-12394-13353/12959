I'm not sure what you mean by "line up", but let me make the following 
observation:  compression coders such as arithmetic coding use
"fractional numbers of bits", so they result in characters not even appearing
on bit boundaries.  So the word "the" will probably be represented
by different bit strings each different times it occurs.  Now I don't
know how to tell what this does to cryptanalysis, but I would imagine
that it makes things more than moderatly difficult.

I apologize profusely for not commenting on the really important discussion
on the merits of TeX for mathematical postings...  :-)

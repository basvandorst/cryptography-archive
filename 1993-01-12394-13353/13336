Lately I've seen an increase in the number of people who "sign" their
Usenet postings with PGP. The multi-line signature significantly increases
the length of short postings.

I think that NSA, KGB, Mossad, etc., have more important things to do
than spoof postings on Usenet. I'd like to propose a more "relaxed" PGP
signature, something like this:

-----PGP SHORT SIGNATURE iQCVAgUBK2RBnTZWl8Yy3ZjZAQG4sAQAx2S6zmm//Y+-----

This shorter signature could perhaps be a "hash" of the real, multi-line
signature that has become all too common here. It would give "reasonable"
security and not waste as much bandwidth.

How about it, guys? Come up with a signature you would feel comfortable
with, but that is less than 80 characters total.

Of course, for postings you thought were "really, really important"
(I don't think that applies to anything I've ever seen posted on Usenet),
you could still use your longer signature.

Is this something that can be added easily to PGP?

Well, and so do mine (to a certain extent).  But unfortunately, it 
doesn't prove, that Dr. Sidelnikov is aware of the message, posted
under his name, much less, that he actually signed it.

Good. Actually, his rank and position are the best candidates
for verification, if possible.

I'm afraid you've lost the point: Dr. Sidelnikov was criticized for
posting an article,  where he made wildly broad claims without ever
bothering to bring any evidence, or support for them.    It's quite
reasonable, I think, to expect that a "professor" knows better,than
just throw some scientific allegations...

Though he didn't bother to show his "analysis", just what he called
the "results", they are being studied now. Of course, until this
little investigation is over - hardly anything will be posted
(except this verbal manure, of course :-).

> The messenger has been attacked but not the message.  

The message is being attacked for being ridiculously imcomplete.
"John, I can read your encrypted mail." Now please confirm, or
deny this "analysis". (:-)

There is too little information to deal with the "issue".  However, what 
can be done, is being done (not as much with PGP implementation, as with
IDEA and MD5. [Don't know when it will be finished, sorry. After all, it
is for free.]

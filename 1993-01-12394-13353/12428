Jim Lynch says that if jano patokallio has diplomatic immunity he
can do anything.

Not without consequences. Though I make no comment about PGP, in
general he can be declared persona non grata and expelled. This
can have both personal and professional consequences.

As to PGP, it is in the realm of possibility that if the U.S.
Government wished and knew about it, he can be accused of
espionage and expelled. If he is not an intelligence person this
can be quite damaging, and if he is and under cover, this will
"tag" him, making his cover useless in future in the U.S. and
in some other countries (if the U.S. has information sharing
arrangements with those countries).

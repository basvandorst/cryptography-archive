It WAS obvious then to anyone who both knew that factoring was difficult
that at least hopefully inverting exponentiation modulo a product of primes
is a difficult as factoring, and was interested in cryptography.  This would
definitely apply to the Rabin method, which is demonstrably as difficult as
factoring.

Some of the other items in Diffie's book might not be classed as obvious
to someone "skilled in the art", but RSA was, as was Galois field 
logarithms, and the use of the knapsack,  Shamir has shown that this
latter did have the desired intractability.

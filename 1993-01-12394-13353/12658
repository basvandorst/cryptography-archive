I'm not asserting you are the only one with these views. I am
asserting that you are the only one who is continuing to post on this
topic, over and over and over again. You remind me of the christians
posting "FIND JESUS OR BURN IN HELL!!!!" messages on alt.atheism. I'm
sure a couple of people agree with you, but you are the only person
around with the bad taste to whip the horse not only after it is dead
but even after it has decomposed. You aren't going to convince anyone.
Lay off.

Well, without any regard to the issue of Sidelnikov's credentials or
reality of existence, I must say that I think Zimmerman was more than
generous considering Sidelnikov did not back any of his statements up
with _reproducible_ data or an explanation of his methods.

As a mathemetician, if someone said to me, I've proved Fermat's Last
Theorem, I wouldn't say great, now I can use it in my work, rather I
would say, _PROVE IT_.

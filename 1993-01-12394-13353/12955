	Yeah, I know.  I screwed up.  Let me make it just a little easier
	to understand if not completely blameless. ;-)  I was off by
	two orders of magnitude because I did the calulation in cm using
	3*10^8 (MKS value of c)  instead of 3*10^10 (cgs value of c)
	as I should have.  When I got 300 cm I said to myself "Oh 3 meters".
	I'm terribly embarassed and I'm sure I will end up in 
	calculation hell for it but even a 1/3 kilometer distance can
	be significant if you are talking about cellular phones.

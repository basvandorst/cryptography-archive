This sounds to me like a very good research topic.

I might start by the observation that a bit of true randomness occurs
whenever I arbitrate something very closely (sample a changing bit exactly
as it changes).  The closer together in time those two events are, the
closer to 1 bit of entropy I've gained when I do the sample (eg., reading
a clock value to store it in memory).  The actual entropy is something I 
can't quantify.  It might need Heisenberg.  Any ideas, out there?

There are probably other ways to get random bits, but this one I know for sure
is random and hidden from anyone who can't scan system memory.

So -- the next step is to go through your system code and find all the places
where the code samples something asynchronously, see how close together
the sample is to a change, see how often the sample is done and treat that
piece of code as adding entropy at a certain mean rate.

The sum of all such entropy additions should give the rate at which the
full system memory gains entropy with time.  I wouldn't be surprised if
that rate were low (1 bit per minute or less).

There's probably much more entropy gained from random typing by the user,
but of course, an eavesdropper could learn all that entropy.

Other ideas, folks?

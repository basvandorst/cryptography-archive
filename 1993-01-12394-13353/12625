No, it is indeed illegal to monitor cellphone calls.  What you cite is
the "old" Communications Act, but the ECPA made even listening to
cellphone frequencies illegal.  It also covers any "coded"
communications, so if someone applies simple frequency inversion
"scrambling" to a cordless phone, it becomes illegal to monitor that.

And again I have to ask, If it was so obvious why, over five decades of
intensive cryptographic research,  did no one else describe or use it prior
to the RSA folks?

Note that they are not claiming to patent the fact that factoring or
inverting exponentiation is hard, the have simply patented what was at the
time a unique and original application of that fact, which is the essense
of invention.

If you want to claim that their invention was not unique and original,
you'll demonstrate that someone else used it or described it earlier.  The
fact that someone else COULD have come up with it can be said of any
invention, so is not in and of itself sufficient.

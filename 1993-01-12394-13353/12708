The only ones I am aware of that were published, 
I thought came from a KH-9 series bird...

Not that obsolete...  KH-11-8 and KH-11-9 are probably still operating,
although we do now have at least two Advanced KH-11s on orbit as well.

There are still certain inherent limits involved in imaging from
an 800 km orbit.  I believe that published KH-9 photo was supposed
to have a resolution of around 1 ft.  The current series can obviously
do better than that...

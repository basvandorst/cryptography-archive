As I understand it, "his ethical position" is that (1) it was illegal under
ITAR to export PGP 1.0 from the US; PGP 2.x was derived from PGP 1.0, hence
it is "fruits of (stolen, misappropriated) property", and cannot ethically
be used.  (2)  PGP is subject to RSA's patents, hence, _ethically_, one
cannot use it without compensating RSA/PKP.

Again, I am not and have never used PGP.  (I DO have it on good authority
that possession of PGP 1.0 was legal in the US, only use might infringe the
patents.  PGP 2.x would have to have been imported which is probably in
violation of the ITAR, and may be in violation of the law authorizing the
ITARs.)

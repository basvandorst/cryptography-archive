Actually, I get important keys directly from the people I want to talk to,
and store them in a flat file.  If RIPEM has to go the server to get the
key, then that means I haven't established any kind of relationship with
this person, and I don't have anything compromising to say anyway.

But, the sever lets me use encryption as an "envelope" (as per Zimmerman's
analogy in the PGP docs) for much more email than I would if I had to
have *everybody's* key in my own public keyfile.  This increases the flow
of encrypted mail, which is a worthy goal by itself.

Also, RIPEM is young.  Give Mark Riordan (and the others) time, and I'm
sure the full PEM spec will be met which includes certificates.

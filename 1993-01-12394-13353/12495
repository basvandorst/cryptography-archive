Only at the margins.  You are correct, of course, that most DES opponents
will fail in the example you cite.  There will be some cases, however, where
waiting 5 years is still very worthwhile.

Also, if one substitutes "decade" for "day" above, then compression wasn't
necessary at all, because it is rare data that needs to be secret for a decade
and the fact that compression moves it up to 640 years is kind of ho-hum.
Maybe the historians will lose out, but that's about it.  Besides, if computation
continues to improve exponentially, it won't be 640 years, which means even
the historians will eventually get a shot at it.

An increase in the work function is always a good thing; but compared to the base
work factor of 2 to the 54, moving to 2 to the 60th isn't more than a marginal 
improvement.  I'd rather go to multiple encryption and multiply by more like
2 to the 54th.

Agreed.  But, that's the point.  Compared to the base cost of 2 to the 54,
an added 64-fold increase may run the opponent out of budget.  But, if one is
worried, why not add larger factors?  There is a lot of uncertainty surrounding
work functions of attackers, after all.  One can never be sure that the cost
to an opponent is entirely linear.  What if the cost is N log(N) and the
compression only adds to the "log(N)" part?

It depends on the cases, but you can certainly construct examples where this
is true.  Question is:  Does it apply to the successful opponent, whose 
technique you aren't sure of?  I'd rather go for exponential stuff, because
it has higher odds of actually adding to the work.

But, an illuminating one, I think.  I claim, still, that compression should
be done as an economy-of-transmission move and not a security move, per se.  If
one fears that 2 to the 54th (or, whatever one presumes the work factor to be),
isn't enough, one should enhance the _encryption_ by a large factor (>= 2 to 
the 32 or so) and take any added security from compression (which isn't always 
available anyway) as a bonus that one does not count on _as a matter of design_.

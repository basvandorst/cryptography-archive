I don't believe even that... Look, suppose -you- have found a flaw in
MD5 and were to comment about PGP. What would you say? "The hashing
function in PGP seems simple enough to defeat"? No, you would say "PGP
uses MD5 as a hashing function and as it has been shown (reference my
paper, or the results of my lab or whatever), it is easy enough to
break it".... My guess here is that Dr. Sidelnikov either hasn't
noticed that PGP uses MD5, or does not know what MD5 is...

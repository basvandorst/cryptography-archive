Sheesh, what garbage. Phil Zimmermann's responses were right on the
mark. If Sidelnikov has a point to make he should present evidence
not conclusions. The basis of science is verifiability, not conjecture.
Qualifications are good things to put into introductory remarks for
speakers but they have no bearing on the accuracy of the statements.

Or have you forgotten how many Nobel Prize-winning scientists had
crackpot theories in addition to their Nobel work!

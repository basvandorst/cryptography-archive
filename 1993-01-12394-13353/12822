I expect that the increased range is due to using digital transmission - not

I would guess that it will scan sequentially through the channels that 
are chosen. That would simplify the software tremendously. Or, since it
is digital, the next channel to be used could easily be transmitted, along
with the voice data. There would be plenty of bandwidth for control signals.

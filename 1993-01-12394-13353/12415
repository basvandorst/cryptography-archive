And according to several histories of cyprtology I've seen, one of the
reasons the US & Britian *quit* using frequency inversion scramblers
for calls between Churchill and Roosevelt was that the techs working
on the system reported that with practice it became possible to understand
the inverted speech! 

Can you say "oops!"? 

I can't verify this, but similar things are well established, so I'd
not consider frequency inversion to be *at all* secure.

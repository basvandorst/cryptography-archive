One second delays in the switching system?  In the phone network?
No way, unless a satellite hop is used -- and they're generally not,
if possible, precisely because of the delays.  In fact, the (U.S.)
phone system is carefully engineered with a fixed delay budget for
each component of the network.  And those numbers are driven by
psychoacoustical research that's comparatively old, I believe.

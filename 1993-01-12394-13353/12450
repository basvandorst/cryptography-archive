Digital signatures won't solve the problem Robert is posing.  The
problem is how do two parties transition from an initial state of
having no way to communicate securely to a final state of having a way
to communicate securely.

If the two parties can use RSA or some other digital security scheme
to prove their identities, then they have already made that
transition.  Put simply, how did I learn to validate your digital
signature?  Sure, the message has a digital signature, but did you
sign it or did George Bush's evil twin skippy?  If I am confident of
my ability to validate your signature, then we must already be
connected by some form of secure path through which you sent me info
on how to do the validation.  Otherwise skippy could just say "Hi Don, 
this is Phil, my digital signature key is ..."

It's a chicken-and-egg problem: You can't distribute a key in a secure
manner without a prior means of secure communications, but if that
means of secure communications is cryptographic, then it requires the
prior distribution of a key.

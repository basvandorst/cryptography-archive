Yes, I have discovered myself several mistakes after the article

corrections... :-)

Right.

Dunno, in the dascription of the language in the textbook from which I
learned FORTRAN it was specified that all unitialized variable
(including arrays) are guaranteed to be set to zero. I'm pretty sure
about this and have even used it in several programs... Maybe it had
something to do with the way FORTRAN compiler were designed than and
with the way memory was allocated. Maybe it is not so any more with
the modern FORTRAN compilers.

Another mistake of mine - this should be Fortran-77, of course...

Ah, yes, nice sample; I haven't thought about that... BTW, my sample
for difficult parsing contains my most serious mistake - I confused
FORTRAN's loop operator with the loop operator in BASIC. The correct
example should be

	DO10I=1  ,N
and
	DO 10 I=1,N

not FORI=, etc.

	True.  But According to a previous posting, it was pointed out,
that monitoring an unscrambled cordless phone conversation and possibly using
that conversation against the party could be held up in Court.  But, monitoring
a scrambled and decoding the conversation is a Felony and not likely to be
addmitted in Court.  I thought, therein, lies the difference! Yes, privacy
is important, but more so, protection in case of... was another problem.
So, it is right, the wired line is best preferred in conversations of
outmost privacy, but now as I understand it, a Cordless phone with a scrambling
feature of one's voice provides some, small, but significant advantages over
non-scrambled voice communication. Is is worth the extra $20?  I think so.

No doubt the members of those congressional intelligence committees
have as much technical expertise and computer experience as the rest
of US industry and academia put together, so the quality and
thoroughness of their reviews of highly technical issues would be of
the same high caliber as a completely public forum, right?

Okay, so maybe I'm overstating this a little. But the cornerstones of
our democracy are government accountability and vigorous public debate
of the issues. And even you must admit that congressmen are
politicians, first and foremost.  Most are lawyers by training. Few,
if any, are engineers. How many do you think have a solid enough grasp
of the technical issues to be able to draw their own conclusions?
Face it, in any technical investigation they'd be forced to take the
word of publicly anonymous experts. And in a case involving
cryptography, these experts would almost certainly be employees of
NSA.

This is what's become pejoratively known as a "revolving door".  I
hope you'll understand if I express just a few qualms about the
impartiality of such a person.

Aren't Inspector Generals nominally in charge of such issues as fraud
and misuse of government funds?

Right. And when Richard Nixon was President, what happened? The CIA
and NSA became the implements of his personal crusade against his
political enemies. Please explain to me how this "civilian oversight"
mechanism will keep these abuses from happening again when the next
Richard Nixon becomes President.

You'll forgive me if I prefer to trust my personal privacy to the laws
of physics and mathematics than to the integrity of any "civilian
oversight" mechanisms in the Executive Branch.

Agreed. Some of my best friends are NSA employees. :-)

Thank you. I'll "cut the cards" by encrypting my communications with
the strongest ciphers I can find. And by defending my rights by
exercising them. Frequently.

Why? We belong to the same species, and there's no law of nature that
says what happened there can't happen here. It's only a matter of
degree.

Quite true. But the institution has a life of its own, quite aside
from the individuals within it. Those individuals may privately agree
wholeheartedly that the policies of the institution are asinine. But
somehow those policies continue. What are we to do about it?

[suggesting that workstations are getting fast enough to be able to use
raw RSA for encryption (cites 2 mintues for a 2K binary file using a 1K key)]

1.	2 minutes is too long to wait for decryption.  RIPEM with a
	key of 1024 bits takes about 7 seconds to do a decryption on
	my Sparcstation 1 and that's long enough to be annoying.

2.	I'd much rather use the higher speed WSs to use longer RSA keys
	and use a more decent secret-key algorithm for the message body.

Not to sound like a broken record, but my favorite candidate is:

	compress|des|tran|des|tran|des

where tran was posted here a while ago -- does a transposition of the input
stream in <= 8KB blocks, using characteristics (the sum, today) of the first
block as the key for the transposition.  This is expensive enough to 
be on the edge of tolerable for a Sparcstation 1.  As WSs get faster,
this will be easily tolerable.

What was missing was that I, for one, find that on my WS I expect to see
the next mail message, full screen, in emacs, in far less than a second after
I press the key calling for it.  I want the same beahvior if the message has
been encrypted -- and don't get it.

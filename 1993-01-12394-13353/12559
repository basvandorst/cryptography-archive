To partly answer my own question:

program oriented toward use with electronic mail.

LICENSING

RIPEM itself (i.e., the code I wrote) is in the public domain.
However, RIPEM is based on RSA Data Security's RSAREF cryptographic
toolkit.  RSAREF is not in the public domain, but its authors, RSA
Data Security, do license it free of charge for non-commercial use.
Because RIPEM uses RSAREF, use of RIPEM is subject to the RSAREF
license agreement.

The RSAREF program license seems pretty straightforward.  It
can be obtained via anonymous FTP from rpub.cl.msu.edu, and is
distributed along with the RIPEM source.  Also, I intend to post
the RSAREF license to sci.crypt.  You should read the license before
using RIPEM, because use of RIPEM is dependent upon your agreeing
to the RSAREF terms.

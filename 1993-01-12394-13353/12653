How about poker by e-mail.  Several protocols were discussed, but here
is another:

Bob shuffles a deck of cards, then composes a message M1 that lists the
order of the cards, appends a 1000 digit random number, and sends a
cryptographically secure checksum of the message (using MD5 for
example) to Alice.  i.e. Bob sends Alice MD5(M1).

Alice composes another message M2 listing the 5 cards she has chosen by
their position within the deck (5 numbers from 1-52), appends a 1000
digit random number, and sends MD5(M2) to Bob.  She cannot see the
cards she picks.

Bob then sends Alice M1.  She can now see her cards, but Bob cannot.

Alice shuffles a separate deck and deals 5 cards to Bob the same way.  
They bet.

Alice reveals her cards by sending M2 to Bob and vice versa.

A protocol involving 3 or more players or using a single deck of cards
is left as an exercise for the reader.

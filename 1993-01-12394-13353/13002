perhaps the reason you didn't see any more comments is that the half
dozen other children who feel these kinds of comments are appropriate
for this group have finished running their mouths and have stuck their
pacifiers back in.  Maybe you'll do that now too?  

The rest of us are interested in the PGP thread as it applies to
crypto.   As far as I can tell, Dave made some points that
should be considered. His account of the russian bureaucracy
makes sense from my experiences  working with them on this side
of the ocean.  Admittedly Dave can use language such that he can
state a position similiar to mine and manage to piss me off
saying it.  Most adults can manage to read through that and to look
at the valid points.

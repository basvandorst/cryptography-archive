Why do you say that? An authenticated channel is much easier to get
than an authenticated and secret channel. I can get pretty good
authentication right now by calling up somebody on the phone whose
voice I know well and exchanging MD5 hashes of whatever information we
want to authenticate (e.g., a public key).  I could care less if
somebody eavesdrops this call, but I certainly *would* care if we were
exchanging secret DES keys instead.

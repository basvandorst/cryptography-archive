This is ridiculous. The one thing this debate needs is some
scientific/mathematical content. Someone tries to inject such content,
using a format which is clear, unambiguous, AND nearly universal, and he
gets flamed by strnlght. I for one would like to see more such posts,
and less of the "is so" "no it isn't" monty pythonesque argument clinic
debates.

Many readers of this newsgroup are fluent in TeX. It conveys the
necessary information elegantly, even in the limited ascii environment
of usenet. It's not even that hard for a novice with a pen and paper to
decipher the TeXed equations in question. (I bet Sidelnikov could if he
really is an Academician in a mathematical field.) The time it takes to
decipher and *think* about the equations may even improve the level of
discussion. This is not to say every post should have gratuitous TeX
content, but sometimes a few equations are better than a thousand words.

Sheesh.

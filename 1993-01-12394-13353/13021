You might want to check out FIPS PUB 113 (May 30, 1985).  If your local
library doesn't have it, it can be obtained from the National Technical
Information Service, US DoC, Springfield, VA 22161 at (703) 487-4650.

I quote:

  The integrity provided by the DAA [DES] is based on the fact that it is
  infeasible to generate a DAC [MAC] without knowing the cryptographic key.
  An adversary without knowledge of the key will not be able to modify data
  and then generate an authentic DAC on the modified data...

All zeros would be a pretty obvious key for an attacker to try first.

OTOH, if you don't care about security and just want a mapping onto
Z2^64, I don't see anything wrong with using a zero key.  But in that
case, why not use the NIST Secure Hash Algorithm (FIP PUB YY, Jan.  31,
1992) (composed with some projection if you don't want all 160 bits) or
one of the Internet hashing functions MD2/MD4/MD5?

BTW, there seems to be no problem using all zeros as the IV in CBC
mode-- in fact that's the mandatory federal standard!

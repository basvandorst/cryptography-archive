This is not likely. None of the existing or proposed US cellular phone
standards have anything nearly as strong as DES encryption; the NSA
simply wouldn't allow it. The best you can expect from TDMA is XOR
with a constant key (i.e., the toy encryption scheme reinvented by
every undergrad CS student.)

Our CDMA system simply spreads with linear feedback shift registers
and has no voice encryption per se at all, though demodulating it will
probably be much more of a trick than "decrypting" TDMA due to the
extra system complexity.

Summary: Was: Another well-intentioned novice's question

An interesting point was made in a previous article about the fact that
the estimates of time for which something will probably be secure aren't
taking into account the rapid increase in the computing power available
over that time...  So I was wondering:

Has anyone got a function which approximately models the progressive
increase in computing power (in, let's say, [Mega]FLOPs) over the years
which might reasonably be used for rough prediction?  Something like
this, incorporated into the equations for probable crack-times would
give a more realistic estimate.

Well, if the government passes a registration law, and demands that I hand
them my private key, I will politely tell it to kiss my ass. Our
government has already way, way overstepped its bounds (considering
that it was created to protect the rights of its citizens; nothing
more) and I will not voluntarily help it to go farther. If such a law
is passed (which I doubt will happen, but you never know) I predict
large-scale disobedience with it, which is proper.

This raises an interesting question. If the government tosses me in
jail for refusing to relinquish my private key as required by law,
it will likely get access to my UNIX account and all the files contained
thereon. My private key is protected by a password, and PGP demands
it each time I attempt to use it. Just how secure is PGP's encryption
of secret keys?

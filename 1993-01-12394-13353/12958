      Is there any interest in a public  site for PGP public keys? If so,
      as a distribution site for PGP I  would be happy to work at setting
      one up. We  would not guarantee authenticity but  merely serve as a
      depository. Allowing  for a site  where one could  either verify by
      comparisom someones key (provided it was  on file) or get a list of
      keys in order to build a key ring.

      Please let me know  if there is any interest in this.  If so I will
      work at setting something up that  would be available under the PGP
      User account.

I'm sure there is.  Like Vesselin, I have been keeping my public
keyring available for anonymous ftp, and I, too, have gotten a lot of
requests for it.  I've also had people deposit their keys if they're
not already in the keyfile.  However, I, too, have been manually
adding the keys to my keyring.  I do know of someone working on a PGP
key server, but I don't know of any expected completion date for it.

In any event, the keyring is available for ftp from:
	toxicwaste.mit.edu:/pub/archive/keys/pubring.pgp

Enjoy!

PGPn123 is a clipboard based PGP shell for Windows. It has the ability to connect with any other Windows based program and sit on top of it without obscuring other windows.

PGPn123 can also run in manual mode, without being linked to another program. In this mode, it will stay on top of ALL windows, ready to exchange data between the clip board and PGP.

Key management is included as a stand-alone module.

PGPn123 is free software. But don't let the price fool you - we absolutely guarantee the quality of this product - or your money back!

Special requirements: None.

Freeware.

Installation: Unzip to \pgpn123 and run PGP_N123.EXE from Windows. A Program Manager group will be created automatically the first time you run the program.

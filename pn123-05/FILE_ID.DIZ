PGPn123 is a clipboard based PGP shell for Windows.
It has the ability to connect with any other Windows
based program and sit on top of it without obscuring
other windows. PGPn123 can also run in manual mode, 
without being linked to another program. In this 
mode, it will stay on top of ALL windows, ready to 
exchange data between the clip board and PGP. Key 
management is included as a stand-alone module.
PGPn123 is free software. Alpha1 Enterprises:

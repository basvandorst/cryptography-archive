<H3>How to protect secret keys from disclosure</H3>
<P>Protect your own secret key and your pass phrase carefully.  Really,
really carefully.  If your secret key is ever compromised, you'd
better get the word out quickly to all interested parties (good luck)
before someone else uses it to make signatures in your name.  For
example, they could use it to sign bogus public key certificates,
which could create problems for many people, especially if your
signature is widely trusted.  And of course, a compromise of your own
secret key could expose all messages sent to you.
<P>To protect your secret key, you can start by always keeping physical
control of your secret key.  Keeping it on your personal computer at
home is OK, or keep it in your notebook computer that you can carry
with you.  If you must use an office computer that you don't always
have physical control of, then keep your public and secret key rings
on a write-protected removable floppy disk, and don't leave it behind
when you leave the office.  It wouldn't be a good idea to allow your
secret key to reside on a remote timesharing computer, such as a
remote dial-in UNIX system.  Someone could eavesdrop on your modem
line and capture your pass phrase, and then obtain your actual secret
key from the remote system.  You should only use your secret key on a
machine that you have physical control over.  
<P>Don't store your pass phrase anywhere on the computer that has your
secret key file.  Storing both the secret key and the pass phrase on
the same computer is as dangerous as keeping your PIN in the same
wallet as your Automatic Teller Machine bank card.  You don't want
somebody to get their hands on your disk containing both the pass
phrase and the secret key file.  It would be most secure if you just
memorize your pass phrase and don't store it anywhere but your brain.  
If you feel you must write down your pass phrase, keep it well
protected, perhaps even more well protected than the secret key file.
<P>And keep backup copies of your secret key ring -- remember, you have
the only copy of your secret key, and losing it will render useless
all the copies of your public key that you have spread throughout the
world.  
<P>The decentralized non-institutional approach PGP uses to manage
public keys has its benefits, but unfortunately this also means we
can't rely on a single centralized list of which keys have been
compromised.  This makes it a bit harder to contain the damage of a
secret key compromise.  You just have to spread the word and hope
everyone hears about it.
<P>If the worst case happens -- your secret key and pass phrase are both
compromised (hopefully you will find this out somehow) -- you will have
to issue a <I>key compromise</I> certificate.  This kind of certificate
is used to warn other people to stop using your public key.  You can
use PGP to create such a certificate by using the <KBD>-kd</KBD> command.
Then you must somehow send this compromise certificate to everyone
else on the planet, or at least to all your friends and their friends,
et cetera.  Their own PGP software will install this key compromise
certificate on their public key rings and will automatically prevent
them from accidentally using your public key ever again.  You can then
generate a new secret/public key pair and publish the new public key.
You could send out one package containing both your new public key and
the key compromise certificate for your old key.

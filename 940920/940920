Some comments on b2

1. Probably a good idea to including compile instructions for rcerts with
the ripem sources--save digging up the ripem-dev message each time.

2. Even better to fix the makefile so you get it automatically, along with
some kind of message to make sure users copy it, as well as ripem to their
binary files.

3. Good idea to include the new IPRA certificate (CRL) in the standeard
issuers option of rcerts.

4. Probably a good idea to tell users how to change their file locations to
take account of the new ripem home directory and dropping of -P etc. A
little hand holding goes a long way in avoiding problems.

I have the following two pairs of certificates in my public key file. Note
the differences in the headers, etc.

I believe one of each came from RSA originally, probably via Ripem Mac,
though I'm not sure.

It would seem that the format of entries in the public key file needs to be
standardized as between Ripem Mac and Ripem (UNIX).

The select a user capability of rcerts is extremely inconvenient to use. One
needs to know the exact format of the user name as the public key file
understands it.

1. Wild cards would be helpful. 

2. Even more helpful would be a select a user option to list all the users
in the public key file, one line per user, with a code before each (a letter
or two) which could then be used to select the user of interest.

Thanks for a great piece of work. Though I'm sure I speak for everyone that
we'll miss your great work on this in future, as an MIT grad I can tell you
that you did the right thing. Your first priority is to graduate, and you
are not at an easy school.

Subject: Re: Instructions and make for rcerts


The following section is from the RIPEM user manual.  It may not be
available in a non-Word-for-Windows format in the unanounced Beta
release.  Would this have answered questions about -P, etc?

==============================
Upgrading from RIPEM 1.2

RIPEM home directory required

RIPEM 2.0 relies on new files such as the CRLs database and the
certification preferences file. Instead of adding yet more command
line arguments, a RIPEM home directory is now required and the CRLs
and preferences files are put there. If you are not already using a
RIPEM home directory, you should move your public and private key
files into there as pubkeys and privkey, respectively. You can use the
default RIPEM home directory, which is ~/.ripemhome for Unix,
C:\RIPEMHOM for DOS, and RIPEM Home in the system preferences folder
for Macintosh. Otherwise, if you do not use the default, then you must
specify the RIPEM home directory with the -H option or the
RIPEM_HOME_DIR environment variable.

-P and -S are obsolete

RIPEM 2.0 also relies more heavily on having a public key output file
for saving Issuer-Certificates from incoming messages. Instead of
requiring -P in all cases, RIPEM now treats pubkeys in the home
directory more as a read/write database. To prevent confusion with
certificates going different places at different times, the -P option
is now obsolete and RIPEM always writes public keys and certificates
to pubkeys in the home directory. For consistency, the -S option is
now also obsolete and RIPEM always writes private keys to privkey in
the home directory.

Getting REVOCATION UNKNOWN certificate status

If you are a RIPEM 1.2 user, you will at first see a certificate
status of REVOCATION UNKNOWN for the users you have validated. This is
because RIPEM 2.0 looks for a CRL from the issuer (which is you) of
the user's certificate in order to see if it is revoked, but cannot
find the CRL. To fix this, run RCERTS and select N to renew the CRL
issued by you. This will create a new CRL issued by you with no
revocation entries.

Note: if you have validated a user in the past but no longer trust
them, you should use RCERTS to revoke their certificate. This is
better than just removing the user's certificate from your public key
file because that same certificate may get re-inserted at a later
date.

The certificate database formats between RIPEM Mac and RIPEM were
never compatible.  The right way to get certificates into a RIPEM
applications from RIPEM Mac is for the RIPEM Mac applications to send
a message and for RIPEM to receive it.  RIPEM will extract the
certificates from the Originator-Certificate and Issuer-Certificate
fields and insert into its database.

RCERTS uses the same name when selecting a user as the -r option in RIPEM.

Definitely.  I intend to put this functionality into a listbox in
RIPEM for Windows.  I didn't spend the time in the first release of
RCERTS to implement a list selection routine.

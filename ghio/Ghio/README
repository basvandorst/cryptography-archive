How to install the remailer

Create a directory for the remailer and put all the files into it.
Edit the file 'remailer', and put the complete pathname of your remailer
directory into the setenv variable on the third line.
Create a blocked-addresses file, and put its complete pathname in the define
at the beginning of readheaders.c  Any mail to addresses in this file will
be blocked.
Create a subdirectory named queue.
Make any cosmetic changes to readheaders.c to add whatever warning headers
you want to be in the outgoing message (such as where to send complaints).
Type "source compile".  This will compile everything.
Create a .forward file in your home directory.  In this file put a pipe to
your remailer file.  For example, if your remailer is in /usr/foo/bar/remail,
you would put in your .forward file: "|/usr/foo/bar/remail/remailer"

You now (hopefully) have a functional remailer.

You should create a remailer-help file.  This will be returned to anyone
who sends you mail with subject remailer-help

To install PGP, generate a new key, put it in your remailer directory, and
put the passphrase into the PGPPASS enviornment variable in the remailer script.

You might want to block whitehouse.gov; it seems that the US Government does
not like to receive anonymous mail from their unhappy constituents.

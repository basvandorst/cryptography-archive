DO IT ALL FOR PGP

Installation:
Do it all can be installed in any directory but you need to make sure that before using program you already have install PGP 2.6X or later, copy all the files to a directory and from windows create an icon (reference file is doitall.exe)


Do it all Help  files :
at this time I have not finished writing the "Do it all" for PGP help files, they will be available at a later date on the next program release, but I have included the PGP help files which is I believe 
more beneficial.

Improvements :
I have beta tested this program with differents user and all the problems have been fixed, but I if find any problem which I doubt let me know I will correct them,  also if there is any function which are not available in "Do it all for PGP" which you will like to see added let me know and I will do it.  My email address is j-ferrei@dircon.co.uk

Comments:
this is a shareware program you are free to use it for a period of 90 days, after that if you like it you should register, this will give you the lastest "DO IT ALL" lastest release as well as the complete helpfiles.

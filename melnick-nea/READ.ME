     NEA.ZIP contains NEA.ASM, the 80X86 assembly language source
code file which implements the NEA encryption algorithm, along
with the C source code required to generate CNEA.EXE, a DOS
command line encryption utility which demonstrates the operation
of NEA encryption.
     Versions 6.0 of the Microsoft Macro Assembler and Microsoft
C Compiler were used to produce the sample program.

<P>Formidable obstacles and powerful forces have been arrayed to stop
PGP.  Dedicated people are helping to overcome these
obstacles.  PGP has achieved notoriety as "underground software",
and bringing PGP "above ground" as fully licensed freeware has
required patience and persistence.  I'd especially like to thank Hal
Abelson, Jeff Schiller, Brian LaMacchia, and Derek Atkins at MIT for
their determined efforts.  I'd also like to thank Jim Bruce and David
Litster in the MIT administration and Bob Prior and Terry Ehling at
the MIT Press.  And I'd like to thank my entire legal defense team,
whose job is not over yet.  I used to tell a lot of lawyer jokes,
before I encountered so many positive examples of lawyers in my legal
defense team, most of whom work pro bono.
<P>The development of PGP has turned into a remarkable social
phenomenon, whose unique political appeal has inspired the collective
efforts of an ever-growing number of volunteer programmers.  Remember
that children's story called "Stone Soup"?
<P>I'd like to thank the following people for their contributions to the
creation of Pretty Good Privacy.  Although I was the author of PGP
version 1.0, major parts of later versions of PGP were implemented by
an international collaborative effort involving a large number of
contributors, under my design guidance.  
<P>Branko Lankester, Hal Finney and Peter Gutmann all contributed a huge
amount of time in adding features for PGP 2.0, and ported it to
UNIX variants.
<P>Hugh Kennedy ported it to VAX/VMS, Lutz Frank ported it to the Atari
ST, and Cor Bosman and Colin Plumb ported it to the Commodore Amiga.
<P>Translation of PGP into foreign languages was done by Jean-loup
Gailly in France, Armando Ramos in Spain, Felipe Rodriquez Svensson
and Branko Lankester in The Netherlands, Miguel Angel Gallardo in
Spain, Hugh Kennedy and Lutz Frank in Germany, David Vincenzetti in
Italy, Harry Bush and Maris Gabalins in Latvia, Zygimantas Cepaitis
in Lithuania, Peter Suchkow and Andrew Chernov in Russia, and
Alexander Smishlajev in Esperantujo.  Peter Gutmann offered to
translate it into New Zealand English, but we finally decided PGP
could get by with US English.
<P>Jean-loup Gailly, Mark Adler, and Richard B. Wales published the ZIP
compression code, and granted permission for inclusion into PGP.  The
MD5 routines were developed and placed in the public domain by Ron
Rivest.  The IDEA(tm) cipher was developed by Xuejia Lai and James L.
Massey at ETH in Zurich, and is used in PGP with permission from
Ascom-Tech AG. 
<P>Charlie Merritt originally taught me how to do decent multiprecision 
arithmetic for public key cryptography, and Jimmy Upton contributed a
faster multiply/modulo algorithm.  Thad Smith implemented an even
faster modmult algorithm.  Zhahai Stewart contributed a lot of useful
ideas on PGP file formats and other stuff, including having more than
one user ID for a key.  I heard the idea of introducers from Whit
Diffie.  Kelly Goen did most of the work for the initial electronic
publication of PGP 1.0.
<P>Various contributions of coding effort also came from Colin Plumb,
Derek Atkins, and Castor Fu.  Other contributions of effort, coding
or otherwise, have come from Hugh Miller, Eric Hughes, Tim May,
Stephan Neuhaus, and too many others for me to remember right now. 
Zbigniew Fiedorwicz did the first Macintosh port.
<P>Since the release of PGP 2.0, many other programmers have sent in
patches and bug fixes and porting adjustments for other computers.
There are too many to individually thank here.
<P>Just as in the "Stone Soup" story, it is getting harder to peer
through the thick soup to see the stone at the bottom of the pot that
I dropped in to start it all off.

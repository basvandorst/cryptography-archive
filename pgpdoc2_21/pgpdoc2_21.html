<H2>Environmental variable for pass phrase</H2>
<P>Normally, PGP prompts the user to type a pass phrase whenever PGP 
needs a pass phrase to unlock a secret key.  But it is possible to
store the pass phrase in an environmental variable from your
operating system's command shell.  The environmental variable PGPPASS
can be used to hold the pass phrase that PGP will attempt to use
first.  If the pass phrase stored in PGPPASS is incorrect, PGP 
recovers by prompting the user for the correct pass phrase.
<P>For example, on MSDOS, the shell command:
<PRE>
    SET PGPPASS=zaphod beeblebrox for president
</PRE>
would eliminate the prompt for the pass phrase if the pass phrase were
indeed <EM>"zaphod beeblebrox for president"</EM>.
<P>This dangerous feature makes your life more convenient if you have to
regularly deal with a large number of incoming messages addressed to
your secret key, by eliminating the need for you to repeatedly type
in your pass phrase every time you run PGP.
<P>I added this feature because of popular demand.  However, this is a
somewhat dangerous feature, because it keeps your precious pass
phrase stored somewhere other than just in your brain.  Even worse,
if you are particularly reckless, it may even be stored on a disk on
the same computer as your secret key.  It would be particularly
dangerous and stupid if you were to install this command in a batch
or script file, such as the MSDOS AUTOEXEC.BAT file.  Someone could
come along on your lunch hour and steal both your secret key ring and
the file containing your pass phrase.  
<P>I can't emphasize the importance of this risk enough.  If you are
contemplating using this feature, be sure to read the sections
<A HREF="pgpdoc2_59.html#0">"Exposure on Multi-user Systems"</A> and
<A HREF="../pgpdoc1/how-to-protect-sk-from-dis.html">"How to Protect Secret Keys from
  Disclosure"</A> in this
volume and in the Essential Topics volume of the PGP User's Guide.
<P>If you must use this feature, the safest way to do it would be to
just manually type in the shell command to set PGPPASS every time you
boot your machine to start using PGP, and then erase it or turn off
your machine when you are done.  And you should definitely never do
it in an environment where someone else may have access to your
machine.  Someone could come along and simply ask your computer to
display the contents of PGPPASS.
<P>Sometimes you want to pass the pass phrase into PGP from another
application, such as an E-mail package.  In some cases, it may not
always be desirable to use the PGPPASS variable for that purpose. 
There is another way to pass your pass phrase into PGP from another
application.  Use the <KBD>-z</KBD> command line option.  This option is
designed primarily for invoking PGP from inside an E-mail package. 
The pass phrase follows the <KBD>-z</KBD> option on the command line.  There are
risks associated with using this approach, similar to those risks
described above for using the PGPPASS variable.

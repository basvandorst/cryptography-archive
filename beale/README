code [123vm] [width] <keytext
	Takes the first letter of each word in the keytext and applies
	it to one of the 3 ciphers.  Default is B1, not verbose.
	Verbose option causes the cipher elements to be printed above
	the decoding.
	'm' switches output to vertical with surrounding elements
	to allow quick checks for 'off by 1' type errors.
	Optional width may be specified. Default is 75 for non-verbose
	and 25 for verbose.
	Compare 'code 2 <doi.original' and 'code 2 < doi.rupp'.  Also examine
	'code 1v <doi.rupp' for the Gillogly strings.

use <keytext
	Each word in keytext is numbered and a usage count in all 3 ciphers
	is printed.  '14.' means that a particular cipher element appears
	once in B1, four times in B2 and not at all in B3.  

modulo [-limit] n
	divides each cipher element by 'n' and records total of each
	remainder.  -limit throws out elements above the limit.  Try
	modulo -500 5.

newlist keytext
	runs all 3 ciphers through a keytext (verbose and non-verbose),
	prints the keytext via 'use' and sorts the keytext by first
	letter (maybe useful?).

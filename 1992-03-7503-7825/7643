The discussion here and most of e-mail notes (thank you to all
who responded!) have generally supported making at least part of my
program public, so I've decided to make a crippled version available.
Although I don't really like this approach, it is really the only
way I can see to demonstrate the problems with PKZIP's encryption
without unnecessarily making peoples' data vulnerable.

Is there an FTP site where I can put this file without it being
sent overseas?  I'm not sure of what the law says, and don't really
want to find out.)

If you'd like a copy via e-mail, send me a message.  The ZIP is
somewhere on the order of 40K and the uuencoded file is slightly 
larger.

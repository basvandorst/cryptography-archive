  I've actually used this program to both compress and encode 
  some software that I sent between systems on a public data
  network.  The software being transmitted was not particularly 
  sensitive but, I did not want it to be sitting un-encoded on 
  a dozen different systems.

  Results wise it did not quite compress as much as the Unix
  compress program.  However, I did forget or mistype a key 
  for one e-mail and have not been able to break it back out.
  (It was a 10 char password.  I've come close and partially
  decrypted the first dozen or so lines but, the exact initial
  splay table state still eludes me.  I'm keeping the file
  around for entertainment.  :-)   )

  I believe that the splay model is very useful as a  compression
  method.  It is however only one possible model.  Since the
  Aritmetic Compression algorithem allows interchangeable compression
  models (of which the splay model can be one) I personally prefer
  the idea of using AC for both compression and encryption purposes.

  Currently I've seen several AC models published.  I have not 
  yet seen a model that was designed to both compress and encrypt 
  in a secure manner.  (Existing published models seem to have
  obvious flaws if used for encryption.)

The more interesting question (to paraphrase a famous line):

  What did the NSA know, and when did they know it?

Some follow on questions:

  - did knowing differential analysis lead NSA to half the key?
    (Presumably the IBM cryto group picked 128 for good reasons).

  - did NSA know anything more powerfull?

  - what motivated the S-box changes? (Since IBM already knew
    and defended against d.a. in Lucifer).


I know these questions are unlikely to ever be answered in the
open, but they are even more interesting in like of the
statement from Coppersmith.

Summary of responses to my query for parallel factoring techniques.

If you're interested in factoring large (60-100 digit) numbers, the best
introduction to current techniques (including the Elliptical Curve Method)
is:

	Factorization and Primality Testing -- David M. Bressoud
	Springer-Verlag ISBN 3-540-97040-1

Bob Silverman lists the best journal articles below.

  For how to implement the elliptic curve algorith, the definitive article is:

    P. Montgomery
    Speeding the Pollard and Elliptic Curve Methods of Factorization
    Mathematics of Computation  vol 48, 1987, pp. 243-264

  For the Quadratic Sieve, see:

    R. Silverman
    The Multiple Polynomial Quadratic Sieve
    Math. Comp. vol 48, 1987 pp. 329-339

  For the Number Field Sieve see:

    A. Lenstra, H.W. Lenstra Jr., M. Manasse, & J. Pollard
    The Number Field Sieve
    Proc. 22nd annual ACM symposium on theory of computing. 
    Baltimore, 1990 pp. 564-572

Thanks to everyone who offered suggestions.

I am kind of interested if RSA intends to allow an intermediate level
of security, that is, the use of public and private keys without
having them in a registry.

This could be used, for example, to establish an identity for a chat
system or mailing, but not one which has my name in it. Anonymous IDs
can be quite useful, and I'm wondering where these fit in RSA's plans.

Huh?  This is news to me -- and welcome news too, if true.  If you, or
anyone else, knows about code that implements RFC 1113-1115, and thus
(presumably) can interoperate with RSAREF, I would love to hear about
it.  I don't believe PGP qualifies, if I have understood correctly
what I read about it.  Or maybe you just meant code that will compute
powers mod N, in which case I am not impressed...

Feel free to simply point me at the right news group -- I guess
sci.crypt is not really appropriate to this discussion.  Thanks.

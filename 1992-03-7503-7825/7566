Oh, gee, just what I needed - an ideological debate.  This line of reasoning
is really silly (i.e. begin flame <grin>).  The premise is that by keeping
as many people as possible in the dark that the status quo is good enough, when
that is indeed not true.  As long as there are professional theives, they will
work against the professional security consultants in a battle to control the
goods.  Knowledge IS power, and those that have one have the other.  While
I am sure that there has been an increase in bike thefts since it was
discovered that the now famous Kryptonite(tm) U-locks are vulnerable to
fracture under extreme cold (that is, the mechanism is vulnerable, so a can
of freon and a hammer are handy tools if you are a thief), the owners of those
bikes can change their actions to offset the threat, and the company can take
action to protect future customers from the problem.  If this information had 
not been kept secret the thiefs would not be forced to try a new method
('cause one looks rather silly carrying a hammer anyway, now everyone can
probably spot one, even though more thieves will try it...)

The same logic applies to T.V. shows such as America's Most Wanted, Missing
Reward, etc.  By publicizing the fact that these people are out there, and are
dangerous forces these same individuals underground - but increases the chances
of their capture as well, so the criminal works harder to be concealed, etc.

The same thing is true for security holes - we advertise for the novice hacks
that there is an opportunity for them.  However, for every baby hack there are
hundreds of innocent users.  If the users know they are at risk then both the
baby hacks and the expert hacks are castrated, although there will always be
users who won't know the facts, and will be more vulnerable, the question is
HOW MANY are there?  I argue that they are too simple to need the security or
don't have anything of great value to a hacker anyway.  THOSE THAT SPEND THE
TIME AND ENERGY TO GET KNOWLEDGABLE DO SO BECAUSE THEY FEEL IT IS IMPORTANT,
I.E. THEY HAVE A NEED, THEY FEEL A THREAT, THEY HAVE NEED OF PROTECTION.
(i.e. NO benefit by NOT advertising risks - thieves have more problems with
deadbolts - not everyone knows this, but you can be sure all thieves do.
You can be sure, though that those in the general public that need to know 
because they are more likely targets because they have something that is
more valuable to a thief will know because it is in their interest).

IN OTHER WORDS, THERE WILL ALWAYS BE EXPERTS WHO KNOW MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE
AND CAN BREAK INTO YOUR HOUSE, BUT IF YOU KNOW THAT, YOU WILL BE ABLE TO TO
___*SOMETHING*___ TO COUNTER THE THREAT, OTHERWISE YOU WILL THINK THAT YOU ARE
SAFE, AND THE THIEF WILL MAKE OFF WITH YOUR GOODIES...if he thinks you have
something that he wants...but if you did then you would probably be taking
action anyway, and so on.


Hell, by the same logic, why publicize the existence of new viruses?  After
all, every time we do it we spread news to other potential or active virus
writers so they can write better viruses, BUT WE HALT THE CURRENT THREAT.
ASSET PROTECTION IS ATTAINED AGAIN, and the bad guys are at square one.

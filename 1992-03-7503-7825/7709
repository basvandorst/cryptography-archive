I was wondering about this as well.  Note that a lot more than a few
initial characters are predictable if a file is known to be a zip
file.  If you look in the file appnote.txt that comes with the pkzip
kit you will find a description of the contents of a zip file.

How much would security be enhanced by having pkzip encrypt the data
before encrypting the zip file?

This method is almost certain to be unhelpful.  Textfiles are
exceedingly non-random; they have all kinds of easy statistics that
cryptographers grab hold of.  Cryptanalysts do this for a living!

What you want is to generate random numbers with a hardware generator.
Ideally you would use a device that reads some quantum event, like a
radioactive decay or gets the thermal noise off a diode.

As a matter of fact, this is cheaper than you would think; if you have
a geiger counter and a piece of radioactive whatsit, you can turn the
gain way up on the geiger counter and then plug the geiger counter
output into the audio port of a digitizing board.  This will get good
random numbers.

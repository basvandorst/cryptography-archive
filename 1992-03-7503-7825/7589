To get RSAREF requires making an agreement (that may not hold up in
court, but we cannot absolutely count on that) that I personally
considering to be slightly giving away some of my rights.  It is just
slight enough that RSAREF itself may or may not justify this in my
view.  I'm not going to just up and take a risk as long as there is
some chance of learning certain things about it.

I do not yet know if some of the details about RSAREF will preclude
usability in the sense I want to use it.  I believe that if the
interface specifications for RSAREF were released to the public
(just the specs, no code) it MIGHT tell me what I want to know.

Until I do know, all I can do is speculate.  If I shut up and go sit
in the corner, the chance of finding out the information will be less.

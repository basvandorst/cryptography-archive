IMHO, _all_ of the 'analogies' made to software encryption (and
_especially_ door locks) aren't worth a pair of dingo's kidneys.

The point we're looking at is:  if you do it right, there isn't
going to be a better method than brute force to recover the plaintext.
This brute force is measured in computing-time, and if large enough,
makes the cracking task immensely difficult and expensive.

For a door lock, the right analogy would be 'there's no way to get
through without trying all possible keys'.  If _any_ door lock could
do this, I wouldn't have to worry about thieves coming in my door.
Door locks have other limiters, however.  For example:  the thief
could take a drill to the lock mechanism (or even the door itself).

Simply put, you cannot build a perfect door lock.  We're not sure if
you can build a perfect encryption scheme, but there are plenty out
there (DES, PGP, etc,etc) that we're pretty sure you'd have to try
every key to crack (or something along the same O().)

I have to agree with the folk who say 'Distribute the tool, for lo,
the public will awaken, and PKWARE will notice and hopefully switch to
a better system, thus improving real security of their customers.'

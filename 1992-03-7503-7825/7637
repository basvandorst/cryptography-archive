The problem with the is that there is an alternative which is more secure.  No,
there are many alternatives that are more secure.  Equally important, they are
available at low cost to the user - they can even take their currently encoded
files and reencode them with a more secure mechanism.  Thus, we force the user
to become more secure.  At least as important (and this applies below, too)
is the fact that as I have said throughout this entire debate, it just makes
no damn difference to anyone what you say until it affects or threatens to
affect them.  Period.  Per previous arguments, a virus, a plastic gun, AIDS,
etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. are somebody else's problem until they have the
possibility of affecting me.  Then I worry.  And, as we all know, per my
other previous argument, just because I don't know that a threat exists
does not mean that it does not exist.  Sure, only the moderate to advanced
hacker has the tool.  So, by releasing it we educate the beginning hacker
and EVERYONE who is at risk (those who have something worth protecting, because
a hacker may want it) is educated.  The margins are irrelevant since they don't
really care and the hacker doesn't want their stuff anyway.  Publicizing and
making a tool available is the only way to make the threat hit home.  Period,
end of story, end of conversation.  There is no other way.  If you think I am
full of it, let us terminate this conversation because it is pointless.

Again, the hacker already has the ability, so if I don't prove to you that
you are vulnerable by giving you the tool you won't believe it and do something
to protect yourself - why do people keep things in safety deposit boxes
instead of in their houses, anyway?

As per above, few will take you seriously.

What?  I can go out today and get for a song the tools to drive away with
your car, or take everything that is inside, etc. etc. per before.

Oh give me a break.  If I want to break into your car, no matter how basic
my knowledge, the tools are DIRT CHEAP and there are no questions asked when
I buy the equipment - more importantly, unless you have never looked in an
auto parts store, never watched the news, and do nothing but absorb EMF's from
your computer you should know that lock picks, jimmys, and eavesdropping
equipment is cheap, is available, and is legal - and unlike guns, require
no documentation.  The tools are there, have been there, and will always be
there.  Do you think your car or house is a threat to be broken into?  Do you
think that you are not being spied on?  How would you know?  'nuff said.

>	No, Security is good but there are many ways of fixing something
>that is broken...

Security sucks, and your system, my system and everyone else's system is
at risk.  I read CERT advisories like everyone else, but the threats are
remote or nonexistant 'cause I haven't been touched.  Yet the fact that I
not only know how to but possess the tools to crack any system including
my own is what drives me day in and day out to protect myself.  If there is
no widespread threat then there is no probabalistic reason to take action,
etc. etc. etc. and I am tired of this silliness.  Please continue this
conversation as you will.  Hold your tools and do not distribute them.  The
only reason I will not distribute mine with sreams and yells and announcements
and so on is if there is no way to go around them - no way forward.

Later, dudes.  I have work to do.

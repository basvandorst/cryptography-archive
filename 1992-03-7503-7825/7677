I am in need of a utility that will allow me to encrypt a program (to
prevent, for example, disassembly).  I envision this utility as
working as follows: 
(a) the utility appends a decryption routine to my code
(b) the utility encrypts my code
(c) on execution the routine decrypts and runs my code

I am told something like this exist for DOS.  I need something that
runs on an SCO Unix machine and also, if possible on a HP 700 box.
Source code would be tremendous.  Pointers to both free and commercial
software are helpful.

Send replies by mail.  I will summarize the results to the net.

	thanks,
	mike

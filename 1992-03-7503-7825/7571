The problem with the tool argument is that without it, the threat seems
remote to most people.  Without CRACK, few would worry about DSA dictionary
cracking as being purely theoretical and the product of someone's imagination.
The tool gives legitimacy to the argument.  The potential for plastic guns
is just a myth until someone not only goes through a radar detector with
one and announces it to the world, but others do so as well - i.e. the tool
is just a prototype until the inventor makes it at least partially public.

Sorry to bring up new arguments in rebuttal but, the other issue to be
considered is that the tool does indeed have legitimate uses.  Plastic guns
would enable air marshals and police officers to not announce their presence
as boarding planes - granted there are a lot of illigitmate purposes, as well.
The same with the tool.  Crackers are useful for the user with a short memory,
or an old file, or an employee that has quit, died, etc. without leaving the
key.

The more nude I feel, the sooner and harder I'll be looking for clothes
(assuming my nudity is not desirable to me).

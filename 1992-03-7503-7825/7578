Security through obscurity does not work.  We can either improve the
state of encryption by the free flow of information and thereby
improve security OR we can allow users to stick their heads in the
sand and use placebo encryption schemes.

If your data is important enough to encrypt, it's important enough to
encrypt well.  There are good encryption programs out there -- and there
are bogus encryption programs.  Part of being a professional is educating
people about which is which.

If DES were broken tomorrow, should the "crackers" keep it a secret?

The following is in the NIST DSS (Digital Signature Standard) about
pseudoprime generation:

>In  order to generate the primes p and q, a primality test is required. 
>There are several fast probabilistic algorithms available.  The 
>following algorithm is a simplified version of a procedure due to
>M.O. Rabin, based in part on ideas of Gary L. Miller.  [See
>Knuth, The Art of Computer Programming, Vol. 2, Addison-Wesley, 1981, 
>Algorithm P,page 379.]  If this algorithm is iterated n times, it
>will produce a false prime with probability no greater than 1/4^n. 
>
>Therefore, n=50 should give an acceptable probability of error. 
>To  test whether an integer is prime: 
> 
>   1. Set i = 1 and n = 50. 
>   2. Set w = the integer to be tested, w = 1 + 2^a m, 
>      where m is odd and 2^a is the largest power of 2 dividing w-1. 
>   3. Generate a random integer b in the range 1<b<w. 
>   4. Set j = 0 and z = b^m mod w. 
>   5. If j = 0 and z = 1, or if z = w-1, go to step 9. 
>   6. If j> 0 and z = 1, go to step 8. 
>   7. j = j + 1. If j < a, set z = z^2 mod w and go to step 6. 
>   8. w is not prime.  Stop. 
>   9. If i< n, set i = i + 1 and go to step 3.  Otherwise, w 
>      is probably prime. 
 
In "ALGORITMICS theory and practice", G Brasssard, P Bratley, Prentice-Hall
1988; page 270; the Rabin Monte Carlo for strong pseudoprome generation is
described. This discription does NOT include lines 6: and 7: of the above
discription.

Question; what is the use of these lines, they seem to end always in line 8
(waste of time) and they are not in the discription of the Rabin algo at all.

Is this a typing error, am I seeing something wrong or whatever??

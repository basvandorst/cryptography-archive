Your descriptions of ECB and CBC are correct (conform to FIPS pub 81).
Both ECB and CBC use exactly 64-bit blocks of plain and cipher-text.

That is a correct description of 64-bit Cipher FeedBack (CFB), but is not
the _general_ description of K-bit CFB.  Unlike ECB and CBC, the two DES
feedback modes (CFB and OFB) defined in FIPS pub 81 are defined for K bit
blocks of plain and cipher text, 1 < K <= 64.  Only when K=64 is CFB the
same as what you described, so it's best to call your description 64-bit
CFB.  Values of K less than 64 are recommended.

Finally, I'll describe 64-bit Output FeedBack (OFB) in your notation:

	R1 = F(IV)  C1=P1^R1
	R2 = F(R1)  C2=P2^R2
	R3 = F(R2)  C3=P3^R3

Because every time a unique value Pn is encrypted, it produces the same
unique Cn.  That is, a string of 8 blanks, or your email id "birmingh",
or any other 64-bit string that may get encrypted repeatedly in a message,
will always produce the same value of cypthertext when encrypted with the
same key.  It will be possible to detect long strings of repeated blanks
or dashes (or RISC CPU instructions) because the ciphertext will contain
repeated 8-byte values.  This gives WAY too much info to the cryptanalyst.
FIPS pub 81 defines ECB only for the purpose of saying that it can't be
used to protect government information.

Finally, although you didn't ask, I often remind "newbies" that "Federal
departments and agencies" may only use DES to protect data that "is not
classified according to the National Security Act of 1947, as amended, or
the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended." (quoted from FIPS 46-1, page 1).
Despite this fact, parts of the DOE use DES all the time for their stuff.

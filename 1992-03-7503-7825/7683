I have thought of producing such (maybe about 100,000 random 32-bit
numbers), in order to remove nagging doubts about whether
pseudo-random numbers are good enough for the Monte Carlo simulations
I run. (I'd use these in combination with the pseudo-random number
generator to produce an indefinite stream).

My plan, if I ever actually get around to it, is to compress several
large files (say of text) with several compression methods, XOR the
results together, and then XOR that with a pseudo-random stream,
preferably generated by a different method than that I'll be using
later. The result should be a set of "natural" random numbers, with
any slight biases in simple statistics removed by the pseudo-random
component.

I'd be interested if anyone else has actually done this, and run tests
on the randomness of the result.

BOOK REVIEW OF:
Title:	Contemporary Cryptology - The Science of Information Integrity
Editor: 	G.J. Simmons, Sandia National Laboratory
IEEE Order Number:	PC-0271-7
LoC location:		QA76.9.A25C6678  1992
Publisher:	IEEE Press
Date:	March 1992
ISBN:	0-87942-277-7

  This recently published volume contains a good general coverage
of cryptology for the technical reader.  There are 13 chapters divided
into 5 different sections.  Many of the articles are reprints of
widely cited papers published in the IEEE Transactions on Information 
Theory, the Proceedings of the IEEE, or elsewhere, but all are reasonably 
current and the editor has done a good job of selecting and organising
the material.  

  The volume is clearly intended for a technical audience having
a good understanding of mathematics and some exposure to information
theory and some exposure to the basic concepts of cryptology.
People within that intended audience will find the volume very worthwhile
and good technical libraries should acquire it.  Highly Recommended

more detail of subjects covered:

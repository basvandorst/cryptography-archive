I seem to remember a discussion of using MUXes to implement
the S-Boxes in DES.  I don't remember if it was on the net
or some other forum.  MUXes can be used to implement any boolean
logic but the discussion seemed to be that there was some
special efficiency in using MUXes in the DES S-Boxes.  I would
appreciate it if someone would give some info or a pointer on
this subject.

Thanks,

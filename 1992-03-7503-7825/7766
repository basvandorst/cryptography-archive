As I understand this method, if you have plaintext p[i] and key
k[i](i=0..N-1), you get ciphertext via:

	c[i] = f( p[i], k[i mod N] )

I can't tell from your description whether f() is complicated or
simply addition.  It doesn't matter much, however.  If it's just
addition, you need much less ciphertext to break it (a small multiple
of N) but it's still easy to break if f() is not addition.


This is broken by taking N different samples of ciphertext:

	c[j + n*N] = f( p[j + n*N], k[j] )

for each j, 0<=j<N.  Each such slice is a simple substitution which
can be broken using methods listed in Gaines or Callimahos (cf. the
FAQ).

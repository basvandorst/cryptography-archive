The "underground" could always modify the code to not do this.  It
is illegal (hence the reference to "underground").  LEGAL uses of
the software would be stuck with it.

That depends on them.  But that is the only terms under which I would
consider getting a registered key.  Also the incremental cost (different
between registering one key and registering two keys) should be small.

Among MANY others.

We'll see.

One thing is that we are not really getting much information from them.
I will only go so far in begging for the information.

But my private keys will definitely NOT be available to them.

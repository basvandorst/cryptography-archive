PKP's patents make such broad claims that they appear to give PKP a
complete monopoly over ANY form of public key encryption.  That is,
one of their patents claims the concept of public key encryption.

That particular patent may not be valid because a patent application
must include an implementation and the included implementation, a
knapsack method, has been broken long ago.  But who knows what a court
would rule?

We're SOL, I'm afraid.  And once the US and Europe stop fighting about
agriculture subsidies and they sign the new GATT treaty (General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade) the whole world will be SOL, since everyone will
then need to increase the scope of patent law to include all kinds of
ridiculous software patents.  It seems that few are aware of the patent
law bomb that the draft GATT treaty contains that forces all its signers
to modify their patent laws.

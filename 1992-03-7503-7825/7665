The program ZIPCRACK.ZIP has been uploaded to wuarchive.wustl.edu as

	/pub/MSDOS_UPLOADS/zipcrack.zip

The program will NOT work with long passwords to prevent abuse and the
program is designed to work, not be elegant.  :-)  It does a rapid
brute force using the 16-bit checksum in the encryption header.

It may not be legal for non-US users to get this file since it relates
to encryption and was posted from within the USA.

Bah Humbug!  At the risk of offending someone at RSA who really does mean
well by this campain, I would say that this is no different than DEC giving
computers to universities since the late 70's.  DEC's only interest was
in making sure that everyone who graduated from college with a CS or EE
degree was a PDP-11 expert.  Why ?  So he/she would insist that their
employers use DEC computers.  Marketing, pure and simple.

It seems to me that if RSA really had *our* interests in mind then there
would be no restrictions on commercial use.  Afterall, to be viewed as a 
standard, it must be used universally.  This will only happen if it can
be painlessly included in commercial applications.

What RSA is really trying to do (IMHO) is seed the market with free copies
of their code, hoping that its use will become widespread.  Then, as
commercial developers realize that they will need to include it in their
products for compatibility, RSA will have a lock on the market.

If these guys were so magnanimous they would be giving it away with no 
strings attached.  They aren't.

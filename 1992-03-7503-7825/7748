Bob,

There are two definitions for a good random number generator.

First, in conventional (Monte Carlo) applications standard statistical
analysis techniques should not be able to distinguish between the sequence
of generated number and a sequence of independent uniform deviates from
the unit interval.

Second, in cryptography, predictability is important. If by examining
a sample of the sequence, one can predict the next number and all following
numbers then the generator is not suitable for cryptography.

Your suggested methods meet the needs of the first case but not the second.
I didn't read the original post but assume that since this is sci.crypt,
the second definition should be in effect.

From a security standpoint, how does PGP compare to DES?  On MSDOS I
have pgp 1.0 and a program called merlin which claims to implement DES
and I use it in CBC mode.  One advantage of PGP is that I have the
source.  From what I've heard, PGP uses the RSA algorithmns.  So I
guess the question is, assuming long, secure, non-obvious,
non-dictionary passwords, which can be expected to give more secure
output - RSA or DES?  What are the tradeoffs?  Encryption times?

Thanks for any info!

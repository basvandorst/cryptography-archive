I don't think this is quite right...  First of all, if you pick the
"first" character on the page then you leak information because of
character frequencies in english.   Also, I'm not sure how you're
planning on getting your character out of the page-line-word
3-tuple... is the reader supposed to determine the proper character
within a word by context?  Now, if you move to a 4-tuple with a
character offset within a word then you run into this frequency
problem again right? (ie "y"'s usually won't be at offset 0, longer
words have more vowels, etc...).  I don't think that this scheme is
going to work very well.

Furthermore, no signature's going to survive the process of reverse compilation
back into a high level programming language, back into a natural language
specification, recoding back into a high level language and recompilation.

That's normally how one "pirates" software.

Copyrights don't even legally survive the transition back to algorithmic
language and natural language, because algorithms cannot be copyrighted.

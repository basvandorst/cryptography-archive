Hmmm... maybe an interesting idea to code information on a very high
integration scale: using patterns of atoms (molecules) to represent
information. Maybe we could use NRA or DNA segments as "files". Or 
lengthy polymer to be the "file" support. I am not sure, tho, if it
has a direct relation with cryptology.

In response to the tools available for analyzing (encrypted) executable.

Modern crackers have probably the most advanced tools there are. A "simple"
program like the Borland Turbo debugger is in 386 mode most of the times
powerful enough tp trace any program. Otherwise there are always hardware
assisted debuggers with realtime trace buffers. Logic analyzers to trace
the information exchanged between a "dongle" and a CTR is available too.

For reverse engeneering the program SOURCER is probably enough. It uses
a 5 pass method to differentiate data, code etc. It is capable of
analzing any program in memory (e.g. after encryption) and produces a 
source file which can be altered and re-assembled. 

I believe most major companies didn't give up protection for nothing. Not
because it is "better for the user" (the want to mane money you know :-) but
just they realized there is no way a program can be copy protected sufficiently.

I thing the only way to solve the problem is by integrating it into the
machine. Each machine could have an unique ID and each vendor an unique
signature. The manufacturer of the machine signs the verification code
for the program. The manufacturer of the program signs a combination of
the program's ID and the machine ID. The machine verifies all signatures.

Probably 1 week after this machine is released the first magazine prints
a electronic device or new ROM layout to bypass it anyway but it sounds
nice.

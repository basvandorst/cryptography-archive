I disagree.  I use crack, and I'm not a brainless cracker.  I suspect I'm
like most users of that package.  I'm a draftee sysadmin who doesn't
have a whole lot of time to devote to writing his own dictionary attack
program.  crack is a godsend for me - I can ensure that users of my lab
are using good passwords without weeks of coding and debugging.  Thanks,
Alec.

Now, if only Univ. policy would still allow me to use the faster comp.
center machines for crack -- as it is I'm stuck on DECstation 3100s.

  Yes, it was a hot topic here about 3 months ago.  A group of three
people cracked the codes of length up to four completely, and seemed to
be on the way to decoding the general scheme.  Some information was
posted, including a program to decrypt the VCR+ codes of short length.
  Then these three were contacted by the manufacturer of VCR+, and
threatened with legal action if they did not refrain from further
disclosures.  There were some very interesting debates in this group
on the viability of such threats. The last information posted was by
one of the decrypters, who said that VCR+ was to specify their legal
position Any Day Now, and that he would post this position to the
net Real Soon. The long and short of it is, since that post no new
information came out (at least in this forum).
  The conclusions are left as an exercise for the reader.

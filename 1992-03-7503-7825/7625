Depends on what you want the source for.  If you want to reverse-engineer
a commercial product, I'd hazard a guess that the company that you ripped
off will sure you for copyright infringement.  If all you want to do is
to do a quick hack or two for your own personal use, why not?  I take
great offense at the "you may not disassemble or decompile" notice placed
on most commercial software packages.  I usually ignore it.  After all, I'm
not trying to rip them off by selling something similar, so why should they
care?

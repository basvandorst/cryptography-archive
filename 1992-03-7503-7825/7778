Could someone recommend a good encryption program for encrypting mail
that works on Sun Workstations?

I would use crypt, but I'm sending mail to a site which doesn't have
crypt, so I'll need to send the source over so that it can be compiled
on their site.

The name of the program and the location of a ftp site would be
extremely helpful.

Thanks.

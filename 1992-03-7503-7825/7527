Even worse is the autoverification... there are at least two programs
that I know of which will allow you to add your own autoverification
to ZIP archives.   And the whole point of autoverification is that you
know someone hasn't been tampering with the archive, so this sort of
blows that out of the water.   As an example, I could unzip McAfee's
SCAN program, add a virus or trojan, rezip, and re-validate it.

sounds like a perfectly credible cipher to me.  It might be bit simpler if you
simply started at the begining of the book and added the numeric sum of the
message and book's letter together... IE
Book, page 1:   "It was a dark and stormy night...
message         "I have found the map....
      I  t     w a s a dark.....
Book: 9 20 00 23 01....
mess  9 00 08 01
      I     h  a v e  found...

code:18 20 08 24 .......

it's fun... it works....   just don't let your enemy know what book you chose
(and make sure it isn't "The little engine that could")

His plans were to use the apparently random numbers as input to a software
random number generator.  He also went to a lot of effort to remove any
periodic trends in the input and measure only the noise.

He offered some arguments that the system was chaotic and therefore
theoretically unpredictable in the long term given any amount of past
output.  I wasn't convinced though I found the arguments plausible.  I
don't have sufficient mathematical background to prove whether he was
right or wrong.  The theorems he cited applied to continuous systems and I
don't know whether they can be extended to computers with quantized time
steps.  The hardware clock in the IBM RT used for the test has 1/1024
second resolution; this is a small fraction of the time taken to gather
data (tens of minutes to hours).

Sorry, I thought it was clear that my flame was aimed at governments, not
RSA.

Unfortunately, between silly government regulations and royalties to RSA
for commercial use, I doubt that this implementation (and thus possibly
PEM) will be taken serious internationally or by the business community.
One can probably eventually work out the royalties, but the belief that
crypto technology is a munition has got to be cured before secure
international mail will be legally allowed.

I realise that this has been discussed before, but I don't know what this
week's interpretation of the US export rules looks like.

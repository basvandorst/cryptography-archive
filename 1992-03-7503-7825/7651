With IBM, Apple, DEC, Sun, Novell, Microsoft, Unisys, WordPerfect,
Lotus, Motorola, etc.  already licensed to incorporate RSA into
systems and applications at no measurable cost to the user
("painlessly"), I don't think you can make the argument that RSA Labs
released RSAREF to "lock up the market."

As stated in the RSAREF announcement, RSAREF is the fulfillment of a
commitment to DARPA to provide free software in support of an Internet
PEM standard. I believe it does that.

I don't think there is an "official" definition. However, note that
case (1) is simply a weaker case of (2). I'd say that in case (1)
you'd have technically broken the cipher, so both (1) and (2) would
be examples of a successful known-plaintext attack.
I'd guess that case (1) would be a more concise definition, since you
don't always have to find the key to break a cipher.

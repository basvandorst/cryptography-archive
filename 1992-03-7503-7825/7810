Check back issues of Cryptologia.  In the early years, they had a series of
articles describing cryptology courses in various universities, including
cryptanalysis.

There should be modern cryptography classes at various places.  MIT has a
series of 2 semesters -- covering no cryptanalysis (at least when I sat in
on them) but still quite valuable.

Meanwhile, there are texts available from Aegean Park Press, for self-study
of cryptanalysis.  Cf. the FAQ's book list.

        No. You don't get it. You don't use linear sequences of text.
Suppose I want to encode the message "foo", I open the book at a random
spot and find the first 'f' - page 44, line 3, word 3. Then I flip a
few pages at random and find an 'o' - page 89 line 12, word 6 and my
last 'o' is page 3, line 5, word 1.

        My ciphertext is now: 44 3 3 89 12 6 3 5 1
 
        This is actually rather hard to break without resorting to
rubber hose cryptanalysis, or wading through my entire library (which
is large) - though I could be using byte offsets into particular
postings from talk.bizarre, for all you know...

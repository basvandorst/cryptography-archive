   I would like to find out what would be the appropriate, best, or most
   usable results of division and modulus operations involving negative
   integers for one or both operands.

   Of course the results would still have to fit:
       b != 0 && (a/b)*b + a%b - a == 0
   but there are at least 2 different ways to do this with a clear choice
   only for both operands positive.

I hopy you mean  b == 0 || (a/b)*b + a%b - a == 0,  but let's not pick
nits...  Whatever you do, PLEASE let the sign of a%b be independent of
that of a.  That preserves the property  (a+n*b)%b == a%b  for all
integers n, which tends to help when reasoning about modulus arithmetic.

That leaves you with two reasonable choices:

    0 <= a%b < abs(b)  or  0 <= sgn(b)*(a%b) < abs(b)

I tend to favour the latter; it makes the formulas (-a)%(-b) == -(a%b)
and (-a)/(-b) == a/b come true.

I directed followups to sci.math only because I imagine cryptographers
will only be interested in a positive modulus anyway, and if this
generates a heated discussion it will fit right in with some other
stuff in sci.math :-)

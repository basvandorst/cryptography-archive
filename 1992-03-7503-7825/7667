Years would be a closer estimate!

Shamir's attack works  only if there  are  15 or fewer rounds; the DES
algorithm as defined by NBS has 16 rounds in it. Shamir has shown (for
the <= 15 round version) that we can do better than brute force; which
is not saying  that  it is  broken,  but that  there  are  (slightly?)
quicker ways to attack it.

The fact that Shamir's  attack  (differential  cryptanalysis?)   works
only till 15  round versions, whereas the regular  DES  is 16  rounds,
makes you wonder if the designers  of DES had  already thought of this
kind of an attack while designing it...

Would someone  else like to comment  on this? I heard  of  all this as
folklore in a cryptography class.

Do I really have to tell you that it IS possible to prove a property of every element of an infinite set?

This is not necessary. A computer 'understands', by evaluating machinecode, one single execution. Your problem is to construct a program, say a 'C' program, that defines ALL  possible executions. This is another exercise.

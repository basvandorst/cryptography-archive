	Force, even if the goal may seem good, is often the worst kind
of evil... Ah but it is for their own good - they can not be permitted
to make their own choices on cost risk tradeoffs ... :-(
[rhetorical point - why ?]

	ANYONE? as in everyone?? YOU say? as in WHO ??
- both questionable and self serving [ to your position ] conjectures...

	Reading your previous paragraph it would seem you are projecting
this shortcoming on others, why ?

>					Sure, only the moderate to advanced

	Keeping this clearly in mind - how many had such a tool before 
and after giving it out ?

>			So, by releasing it we educate the beginning hacker
>and EVERYONE who is at risk (those who have something worth protecting, because
>a hacker may want it) is educated.  

	Compare above, how many before and then after are at risk ? Recall that
those at risk before were only at risk from those who had such a tool. Now
relate the two factors together...

	You forget many [most ?] of those whose data was of lessor value
yet now costs nothing at all for someone to get at it - one would guess 
you write off their immediate cost as simple collateral damage ??? 
[rhetorical point ]

>			The margins are irrelevant since they don't
>really care and the hacker doesn't want their stuff anyway.  

	Their are 4 logical states here - you mention two of them. More over,
you forgot - it now costs nothing for crackers to break their stuff once
you hand out the tool... You kill any margins - now even the simple cases
must have better protection...

>				Publicizing and
>making a tool available is the only way to make the threat hit home.  Period,
>end of story, end of conversation.  There is no other way.  

	If you are right and people don't listen then publicizing will do
no good in any case - because if it could then another way must exist
that invalidates your earlier claims regarding education! *If* you
were right they would wait until being hit by the tool - thus the
risk to the data, you care so much about on their behalf, is greater!
Thus logic alone fails to explain your actions...

>			why do people keep things in safety deposit boxes
>instead of in their houses, anyway?

	It is better then other methods and more over safety deposit boxes are 
weak compared to yet other methods - it is a risk cost trade off - hopefully
someone doesn't change these issues BEFORE one can adapt.

>What?  I can go out today and get for a song the tools to drive away with
>your car, or take everything that is inside, etc. etc. per before.

	Why not follow your ideal and unlock the doors on every car you
can to help "educate" people of this great problem they face? :-(

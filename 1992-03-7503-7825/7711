As I am sure most readers of this group know, the encryption on
ARC archives is rather easy to defeat.  Today I wrote a program that
finds ARC passwords.

Two questions:  First, is a similar utility already available?
If not, is there any reason to release the program (in either a 
crippled or fully-functional form) since it is already known that
XORing passwords makes for a rather poor form of encryption?

Thanks in advance for any input/suggestions!

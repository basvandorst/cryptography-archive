I have a challenge to break a small piece of text encoded
with an "ELM encryption" scheme.  Unfortunately, I have no
idea what this scheme is, or if it is reasonable to try to
break it.  If someone could email me specifics about the algorithm
or pointers to sources for that kind of info I would appreciate it.

Followups will probably not be seen, as I don't read this group
normally.

Any help would be greatly appreciated though....

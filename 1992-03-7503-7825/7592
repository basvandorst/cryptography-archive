I'm looking for parallel number factoring algorithms.  Actual code
is fine, as are any references to the literature.

I'm particularly interested in the methods used by the people who
go for the RSA challenge lists - the elliptic curve method is one
example.

Please email your reply.  If there's interest I'll summarize the
answers.

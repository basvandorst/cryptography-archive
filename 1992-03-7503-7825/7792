	I was wondering if you could help a newbie figure out what's going on.
I think I have this down from reading this group and looking at peoples' code,
but could somebody spare a little time to tell me if I understand this?

	Okay, F(M) is your favorite encryption algorithm (say, 16-rounds of
DES) which takes in a plaintext block M and spits out a scrambled block of the
same size. 

	Now, as I understand it, if you do this:
	C1=F(P1)   Where P1 is the first plaintext block
	C2=F(P2)   and C1 is the first ciphertext block

	you are operating in electronic codebook (ECB) mode. Right? 

	And if you do:

        C1=F(P1^IV) Where IV is a block based on the key
	C2=F(P2^C1)
  
        you are doing cipher block chaining and

        C1=P1^F(IV)
	C2=P2^F(C1)

        is cipher feedback. Am I right?

        Now, as far as I understand, ECB is a no-no. Why is this?

 I don't speak for Fermilab, although my mouth is probably big enough..
 Fermilab is going to be visited by the "Shanghai Rod Puppet Theater."
 I've heard of hand puppets; where do you wear a rod puppet?

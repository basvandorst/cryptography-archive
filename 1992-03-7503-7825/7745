I've looked at the RSAREF stuff a bit.  By itself it's pretty 
useless.  It's basically intended to just produce a library that will be
linked with code implementing the PEM, "Privacy Enhanced Mail",
standard.

What is the status of implementations of PEM?  Are they available?
Is the "standard" fully standardized, or does more need to be done
before conforming software can be written?

How much longer will we have to wait?

Another point - it's clear to me what the real reason is for why
the RSAREF license restricts users of the package to call it only
through the specified interface points.  It's to protect the monopoly of
RSA Data Systems, Inc. (RSADSI) on producing certificates for users'
public keys.

According to the PEM RFC's, RSADSI will, for $25, sell any user a
certificate that he can use to prove that his public key is valid.  The
certificates are good for a two year period.  The RFC's state that
RSADSI has a monopoly on doing this, at least in the U.S.  Therefore,
users must be prevented from using RSAREF to create signatures, or else
RSADSI would not be able to make their money.  This is done by forbidding
users to use the package for any functions other than those that are
specifically listed.  Creating key certificates is notably absent from
the approved list (checking certificates is, of course, permitted).

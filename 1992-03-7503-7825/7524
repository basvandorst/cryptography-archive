IMHO, a truly secure encryption is going to be sufficiently large that
even the most efficient cracking code in the world, running in parallel
on all the machines in the world, should take at least all the time
that all those machines have ever existed, to crack just one key.

If a simple method of encryption can be cracked in a mere half an hour
with the computing capacity most people can buy, then I would say by
all means it should be widely distributed, mostly to expose the
deficiency in the system.

On the other hand as long as you want to retain the ability to take
advantage of the deficiency, you could keep the cracking program a
secret.

Another alternative is to distribute it encrypted.

	I was meaning that as example, and wound up totally shooting
myself in the brain. There's lots of way you could do it - you could
just use a character offset into a page - that'd probably do a little
better at the expense of readability. Hell, I was just trying to point
out that there are better ways of doing book-pads than just the
naive "grab a paragraph of text and add it" approach.

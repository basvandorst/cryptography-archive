No (well, not as far as I know anyway:-).  The formula for a generalized  
magic square is:  
  
    a-c  a-b+c  a+b  
   a+b+c   a   a-b-c  
    a-b  a+b-c  a+c  
  
where 'a' is 1/3 of the magic number (thus the magic number has to be a  
multiple of 3).  In addition, if the numbers of the square are to be  
consecutive positive integers, 'a' must be >= 5, 'b' must be 1, and 'c' must  
be 3.

It doesn't matter.

+---------------

Cryptographic hashing functions examine *all* of the data and do complicated
things on it (usually several times). A byte-by-byte comparison will always
be *much* cheaper, assuming you have the pervious version locally.

Now if the two versions to be compared are very far away from each other
and the cost of computing a complex hash function over the whole file is
less than the cost of transmitting the file... But that's another story.

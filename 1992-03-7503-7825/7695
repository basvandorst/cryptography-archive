Ok, so now we can get some megabytes of random bits...
But this is fix data. What really would be nice to have
is a little box with a battery or power cord on one side
and a RS232/V24 plug on the other (I suppose that is
somehow the least common denominator for interfacing)
to attach to our local equipment and run off or private
random bits. Anybody offering that?

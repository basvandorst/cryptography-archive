I have been archiving sci.crypt on cl-next2.cl.msu.edu since 
10 January 1992.  The archive isn't yet organized the way I want,
but the articles are all there, along with an index of the
Subject and Summary lines.  

cl-next2 attempts to limit anonymous FTP access to USA and Canada sites.
(Let's not debate the wisdom of this.)

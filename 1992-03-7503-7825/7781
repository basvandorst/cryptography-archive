In an article in todays (well, yesterdays) New York Times on
negotiations between the Sortware Publishers Association and the NSA
over allowing encryption capabilities in software packages to be sold
abroad, the following appeared:

      [an] internal memorandum, which was circulated to the
      association's governmental affairs committee on March 11, says
      the NSA has said that two cryptographic programs available from
      (RSADSI) are acceptable in mass marketed software.

So my questions are: what are the programs to which this refers?
                     why ISN'T NSA worried about them?
and, finally,        how long has RSADSI been marketing products,
                     what are they, and how does one get a brochure?

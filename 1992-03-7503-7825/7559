Sorry if this is a FAQ.  I scanned a backlog of messages and didn't find
anything like it.

Is there a symbol which is generally used to represent an unspecified
encryption function?  For example, S is entropy to Chem Es, I is current
to EEs.  Sigma is summation, and a long, skinny S is integration.

Thanks in advance.

                                  Chris

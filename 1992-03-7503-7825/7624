A disassembler only takes a couple seconds to disassemble the code.  I can
easily write one that does control-flow analysis and even some rudimentary data
flow analysis (even deriving the run-time values of variables on different
paths) in a couple hours, if my life or livelihood depended on it.

So if it's on disk, it might as well be public domain for anyone who REALLY
wants the source.

Where can I find a source which explains how Rivest's MD[45]
cryptographic hashing algorithms work?  Are they based on RSA?  How do
they work for hashing very similar files---say, C source code in an
on-going development environment?  A certain up-date operation we might
do takes a long time, and we don't want to have to do it if in fact the
file hasn't changed, but we also don't want the overhead of a complete
byte-by-byte comparison.

I don't know how many people have noticed, but in the March 17
edition of PC Magazine a column authored by a fellow named
John C. Dvorak claims that the DES algorithem may be broken.
Quote:
"... And finally RSA's Adi Shamir is believed to have cracked the
old but still useful Data Encryption Standard (DES) by using math
alone!  Until now, a DES encoded message would require hours of
supercomputer brute force to crack."

If this is true, life is going to get interesting in short order.
Any comments?

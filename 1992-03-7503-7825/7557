In the course of working on implementing a login and a passwd 
utility for the Atari ST -- to emulate the UNIX ones, since having
your ST appear to be UNIX is very easy if you're on the net-- I
want to implement encrypted passwords. 

Does anyone have a fast, small, portable, very standard K&R C 
source for a good encryption? I'd like something that gives an 
ASCII encrypted string, so the passwd file can be readable in 
an editor (for adding users).

If anyone can help, please e-mail me so you don't clog up the net. 
Or just post :).

Scott

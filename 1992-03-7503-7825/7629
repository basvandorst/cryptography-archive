I would like any information someone would like to share about the video-
cipher II by GI.  I special would like to know the addresses of some key
information.  The unit ID and key selector, units TIER MASK, unit key, and
any other addresses of importants.  I know the seed keys and where they are
located and the MONTH key.  I would like the addresses to correspond to a 
wizard chip.  Also would like to understand the service ID and unit key selectors for all units being served by this programmer.  How do you know which 
programmer is being shown.  

How does PAY PER VIEW differ from other programing being deciphered.
Thank you.

The problem with this approach is that the decryption routine (including
the key) are part of the program, and are accessible to the user.
Anyone willing to disassemble your code is probably willing to
disassemble the decryption routine and use it to gain access to the
code.

You're better off making your program long and complicated and then
stripping out the symbol table.  That's what most commercial software
vendors do :-).

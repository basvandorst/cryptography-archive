  One would HOPE that Kerberos _V5_ would be what people specified and
implemented rather than the older _V4_.  The security differences are
between the two versions aren't trivial.


  While I'm at it, Peter Honeyman has an interesting Tech Report available

P.S.
  I've set followups to comp.protocols.kerberos, if you are following up
and that isn't really the right place, please use common sense and EDIT
the newsgroups line of your posting. :-)

I understand LZW is owned by Unisys, perhaps the stalwarts in comp.compression
would be best placed to answer this?

If you are going for a compression technique to be a standard in the packet
world, why not go for one of the latest techniques? HPACK, LHARC, LHARC
all have source code available, approach the authors and see if they'd
mind an advance in the world of Packet Radio...

Dosen't compression count as encryption tho? What are the issues with
encryption and packet radio?

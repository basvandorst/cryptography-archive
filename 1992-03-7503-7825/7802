I hope that Cray at least publicized the range of primes which they checked.
Actually, if they did do that, I don't see how it "would have MUCH more value"
to know that the Cray prime is also the Next :-) prime --- after all, even
laying aside the controversial matter of just how much value such results
have at all [outside of "marketing hype and publicity"], one could make an
argument for computing a distant data point as opposed to just accumulating
consecutive data points; presumably you don't have a quarrel with Odlyzko's
skipping over gobs of zeros of the Riemann zeta function...

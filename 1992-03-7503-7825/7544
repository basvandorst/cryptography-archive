Well, MD4 and MD5 are available for ftp, and there are lots
of des implementations and long integer libraries available outside
USA. When we have specs, there is nothing to stop us creating 
free combatible library. (RSA is trivial when you have long integer
routines ready) No need to bother your congressman ;-)

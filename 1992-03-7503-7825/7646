I've tested the performance of the rsaref package on a couple of
machines, I thought people might be interested in the results.

It comes with a demo program called rdemo which allows exercising some
of the functions. The demo program has two built-in keys, and allows
you to generate a 3rd key, with a length of 508 to 1024 bits. The two
built-in keys are both 512 bits. There are several test scripts and
test files for verifying the operation.

The tests generally generate a key, verify a signature file (from a 13
byte file), then decode and verify a message signed by the 2nd built-in
key and encoded with the newly generated key (which is the same every
time you run the program, since it starts off with the same seed for
randomizing). The exception is the 512 bit test, which uses the 1st
built-in key instead of generating one. There is also a test which
verifies that the md2 signature is working. It only verifies the
signature (of the 13 byte file) using the 1st built-in key again. All
the other tests use md5. The decoded file in each case is 182 bytes,
except for the 512 bit key which is 203 bytes long.

On a Sun 3, running SunOS 4.0, the times to perform the various tests (user
time as reported by the "time" command) were:

200	Generate and uses a 508 bit key
9.5	Use the 1st built-in key
1014	767 bit key
7322	1024 bit key
1.2	Verify only, using md2, using 1st built-in key

For the 1024 bit key, the time spent to actually generate the key was about
7270 seconds. The rest was the verification and decoding.

Tested on a MacII, the time to generate the 508 bit key was 586 seconds
(using Think C 3). The time to decode and verify using the 508 bit key
was another 24 seconds.

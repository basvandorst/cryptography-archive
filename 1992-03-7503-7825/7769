I haven't looked at Peter's NSEA algorithm, so I don't know much about it.
But I'd like to point out that even a properly-used DES package in CFB
mode would "fail" the same way that NSEA "failed" your test.  Any block
cipher, whose block size was less that the size of your file, would behave
this way.  The avalanche effect from a small change in plaintext will
propagate to the end of the file.  Since your change was in the last byte,
the behavior you observed is correct for any block cipher in CFB mode.

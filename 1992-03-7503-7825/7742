Cylink Corporation makes such a board. It uses a noisy diode for an RNG and
includes a high-speed DES chip for encryption and a high-speed exponentiation
processor for use with Public Key techniques (such as Diffie-Hellman, RSA,
El Gamal, and DSA). The board is IBM-PC compatible and is only a half-card in
length. Please contact me for further information.

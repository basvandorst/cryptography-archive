Poetic license.


"hours of supercomputer brute force" is more like a century than hours.
(1 century if you do a little over 10 DES operations per microsecond).

Just using math is bogus.  He still needs to run DES MANY times -- only
fewer times than brute force.

Meanwhile, "RSA's Adi Shamir" suggests that he works for RSA Inc., which
I don't believe he does.

Other than that, this was a great piece of news reporting.

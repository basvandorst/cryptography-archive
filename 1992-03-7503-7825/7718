I know... I was the author of ZIPCRACK also.  :-)  I was able to justify
releasing a crippled version of my code as an incentive for PKWARE to
fix the encryption.  I didn't know that the program had made it to
garbo and am bothered that my requests that the program stay in the USA
were ignored.  Wonder what US law says about foreigners violating the
US encryption export restrictions...

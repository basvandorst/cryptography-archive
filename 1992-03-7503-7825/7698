Someone who used to work here used a disk drive to generate random numbers.
He measured the time required to read a disk block and used the variation in
that time (after much preprocessing) as a random number source.  A large
part of the variation in disk rotation speed is caused by air turbulence, so
there is some physical as well as observational evidence that these numbers
are random.

I've heard that CMU used arrival times of ethernet packets to generate
random numbers.

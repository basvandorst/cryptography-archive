Read the license agreement.  You aren't allowed to distribute the documentation
or any part of it.  Further, your posting had a distribution of 'na', which
allows distribution outside the USA (and if anyone believes that a
Distribution: usa header alone will prevent the article from leaking
outside the USA, I have this bridge for sale ...)

No, but I bet NSA did.  NSA probably has a lot of influence on private
corporations if it wants to.  And if you recall, I claimed that you would *NOT*
need to reveal the private key to register one.

>Please people, verify your facts before flaming. RSAREF is available

I did not and do not consider my article to be a flame.  

>*now* get a copy and examine it rather then speculate how it works
>(not to mention being paranoid about it).

I sent for a copy of RSAREF before writing my article.  If it had arrived 
before I sent it, I couldn't have sent it, because answering questions like 
"does the interface require certificates" would violate the license agreement.

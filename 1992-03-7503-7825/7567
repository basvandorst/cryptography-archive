Hi Mike,

	_If_ that were my line of reasoning I would agree too! :-) However my
point was to question the issue of being informed of the nature of the risk vs
handing out a ready made tool for doing so. In that case my observations simply
attempts to relate to observed effects from the "real" world...

	And work they may have too - but give that tool (vs say knowledge)
to everyone and the issue is mote - whereas if people are simply informed 
the playing field is one where you may have a chance of staying ahead ...

>Knowledge IS power, 

	True! 

>			and those that have one have the other.  

	They have to devise the tool first - if they can. 

	Now give a _premade_ tool (no work involved) to break a system 
to everyone.  Question, now _who_ has the greatest power at that time ?
Question, could the nature of the risks involved be explained without giving 
the finished product away ? (those were the issues I was concerned with)

	Yet a such a lock is harder to break then a cable lock which itself
is harder then a chain lock. It is harder becuse no free tool has been
given to everyone to break all such locks. Reals issues of risks often
reflect the number/cost of such tools out their and the time vs payback issues.
Consider what use the lock you mention would have been if overnight 
everyone had free access to a tool to break it rather then just say the 
knowledge that it could be broken with a certain tool and or cost...

	There is a difference between the knowledge and the tool itself - 
my only point. Keeping people in that dark of course is a VERY bad idea and
any hint of that as my issue was merely an illusion caused by the context of the
issues I was trying to address.

	This is great, my point exactly! Tell people the risks but don't
make copies of all such people and pop them in to every house on the planet
to so as to "inform" everyone sort of idea -> Sure it gets the problem
out their, but there has to be a better way...

....

	Add to this the question of how many people know the hole and also
would wish to breakin, add the value of what is locked up, and risk issues
become clearer... In the "real" world ( :) we keep money in vaults and our
lunch in the cooler. If everyone had a habit of swipping your lunch
things might change somewhat - enter the world of risk assessment...


>(i.e. NO benefit by NOT advertising risks - thieves have more problems with

	There also comes a tradeoff - Why spend money on a lock when a window
may be your greatest risk? Say a friend tosses a rock through your window so as 
to increase your state of knowledge ? He could have told you instead. Also 
spending lots of money on door locks may be better spent via other means...

	Agreed.

	I would add that there is a cost/risk tradeoff that few are willing
to speak of when the issue is one of software...

	Thanks for your comments Mike,

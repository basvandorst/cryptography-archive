Recently I suggested that a book could substitute for a one-time pad.
I've gotten several pieces of mail claiming the method I was proposing
was trivial to break.  Others have said it is not.

So my query to the netexperts is: which is it?

The method I'd heard of:
	Cleartext:	The Rain in....

	1) Open book at pseudo-random. 
	2) Close eyes, point to somewhere on page.
	3) Open eyes, find nearest  'T'
	4) Page 38, line 7, letter 37 
	5) output 38737 or such as encrypted 
	6) Mark page so you do not reuse it.
	7) Loop to 1) for "h" 
		and so forth.

Now, if you never reuse the page, or maybe the paragraph, have you
provided enough data so that someone without the same book can decide
it or not? I've gotten different answers.

{I can't remember where I heard of this, but it was in the popular
press somewhere, maybe a novel.}

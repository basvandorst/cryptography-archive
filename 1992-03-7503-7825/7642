About the security of zipped files:

How good is it to compress a file, then encrypt it? This seems like a
pretty good method to me. The only problem I could see would be if all
zipped files have the same initial characters. If you then changed
the extension so that someone trying to crack the file would not know it
had been compressed, would this not offer really good protection?

I haven't studied much encryption theory, so please forgive me if
my questions seem a bit naive.

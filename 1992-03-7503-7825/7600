Precisely - making it all the more important that a solution be found and
used NOW.  Necessity IS the mother of invention - refer to the nudity argument-
if I do not like nudity and have my clothes stolen, it will be imperative for
me to find something to wear immediately, and again, until the threat is
widespread, only the most serious users will take the threat seriously, e.g.
the virus argument - I didn't need protection until the problem hit home - now
I do.  Most users are afraid enough of viruses to stay on top of the problem.

Certainly planting bombs will illustrate the need, but the argument is
repugnant and extreme.  We are not talking about death at this point - which
is certainly an issue that most humans take far more seriously and are much
more emotional about.

No, but it does indicate that humans are wary of claims without proof.  No gun,
no problem.

And yet any idiot, felony conviction or not can go to any auto parts store and
purchase a jimmy set, anyone can purchase a lockpicking kit, and there is no
restriction against any American (or foreigner, for that matter) purhcasing
eavesdropping and counter-eavesdropping equipment.  While the use of these
items may be illegal (unless in one's own home, of course - to one's own
property), they are readily and widely available, and thus they remove any
of the security associated with the locks.  So, should the alternative be to
institute stricter penalties for electronic tampering?

For all these see above on availability of tools.

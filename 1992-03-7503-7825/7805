This may seem like a terribly elementary question to many of you, but
it's one I need to ask.  How does one acquire the knowledge and skills
to become a professional cryptographer or cryptanalyst?  It's not like
this is a subject area found at every University.  Here at the
University of Illinois, which has well-established and respected Math
and Computer Science departments, there is not one single
technically-oriented course offered in the area of cryptology.
(Occasionally a faculty member in the Business Administration
department offers what has been described to me as a nontechnical
survey course.)  When I've spoken in the past to people who had worked
or done research in the field they said they acquired their early
training at NSA, CIA, DIA or one of the other military intelligence
agencies.  All well and good, but these days you can't just pick up a
job at one of these places and learn as you go.  Neither am I talking
about information of the kind one typically finds in the research
journals.  How does one obtain the basic special skills?  Your
audience holds graduate degrees in Computer Science, Math, or both and
is well-versed in logic, combinatorics, and complexity theory.

Many thanks for all helpful replies, by e-mail or follow-up to sci.crypt.

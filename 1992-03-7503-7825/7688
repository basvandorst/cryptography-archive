Is there an FAQ or any filed postings, etc regarding how the VCR Plus
channel/time codes are done, or any overview of their characteristics?
VCR+ was recently introduced into Canada, and the codes seem to have
little rhyme or reason.

Please *e-mail* responses, particularly if I've stumbled onto a previously
hot topic here.

thanx

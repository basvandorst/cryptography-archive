	Question: If someone gave *everyone* lock pics to all of the locks you 
use now what changes for your security? A good lock smith (analogy programmer) 
will tell you that most locks most people use are easy to break- if you have 
the tools . All you are in effect doing is giving everyone the tools that in 
effect make _certain_ that all your locks will become  of little use. The 
question of why a lock is good enough often comes down to a cost tradeoff - 
when one talks of hardware.  The problem with software is that someone can 
spend money on a solution then someone else can then break it, but worse, 
GIVE AWAY the solution to break it for almost free. Yet if someone did not 
give it away the lock would be useful as long as people stayed informed
of the risks (ex: how many pics, etc) Giving away cracking software does 
help people understand the issues but as a bad side effect it creates 
a cost in direct relation to the number of free software/lock pics out there
- that MUST then be paid to keep security at a given level. It in effect
forces more of a market where little was before. So where do we start ? Does 
someone next bust windows, smash holes in walls or set fires, then repeat anew, 
to show how unsafe we are without "good" security. "good" security often 
reflects the current state of knowledge - if you keep telling _everyone_ how to 
break things "good" will never be good enough. Criminals may always try
to obtain such tools for bad uses but not _everyone_ of them has them - what 
is at risk is always a matter of degree of protection in relation to what
else is out there. I think being well informed is a solution but each
method of informing has differing risks all by themselves...

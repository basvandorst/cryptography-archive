For a good historical overview and survey of public key cryptography
and some of its uses (including a brief introduction to RSA), see

	W. Diffie
	"The First Ten Years of Public-Key Cryptography"
	Proceedings of the IEEE 76(5) [May 1988], 560-577

Note that you almost certainly *don't* want to write your own
RSA code.  Good implementations are already avaliable from several
net archives, including ones located outside the USA and hence
not subject to their crypto export laws.

Note that to achieve good security with RSA (or any other cryptosystem)
demands much more than just the RSA (or other crypto) code.  In
particular, it requires a carefully designed, implemented, and
used set of protocols for key management.  As well, in practice
RSA is too slow to be used by itself -- instead, it's typically
used to set up secondary "session keys" for a faster cryptosystem
like DES.  Again, the protocols governing how this is done are
critical to good security.

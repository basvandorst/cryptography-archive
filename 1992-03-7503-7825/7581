I read in the paper (Boston Globe) today that the FCC wants to require
all broadcast and fiber carriers to insert wiretapping mechanisms into
their hardware/software to comply with government subpoenas.  They
want the cost of these features to be part of the rate base for
regulated carriers, so that we end up paying for the right to be
deprived of our privacy.  As usual, the "war on drugs" is the putative
reason.  CPSR is already on the case, but I think we've got a serious
fight on our hands.  The best that can be said is that at least they
are being up front about it, instead of gently hinting that
manufacturers be "sensitive" to the issue.

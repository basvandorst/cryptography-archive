	The downside: this is a case where the mass distribution
of the tool itself makes the threat real and _immediate_ for everyone.

	Like planting bombs in everyones house to illustraight the threat
of them - All I am saying is there has just got to be a better way. Education 
comes in many forms...

	Does this suggest that no amount of press can make people understand
or believe so that there is only one way to do it?

	In general this a good point one needs to address the whole playing
field.  In this case however it may be at direct odd's with the goal of 
increased protection. [ ex: If protection is not the goal then why would one 
want good locks? You can't ever have BOTH when the tool is given to everyone 
- big problem ] So even in cases were the breaking of locks were legitimate 
[ one's own ] breaking such a lock in software trashes the locks value - for 
everyone if you give it away. It does not solve the problem of the 
weakness.

	Given it were useful, would the risks of bringing such a tool 
be as well understood by everyone as it's benefits ? In one case you have
the tool itself, with all it's uses, and in the other case nothing at 
all to protect someone from it's immediate harmful uses. 
Ok, here is the crunch:
	In one case someone claims to have everyones best interest in mind 
	when providing such a tool, as the best means for education, yet what 
	is provided for its risks - NOTHING.  So any claims of best interests 
	is weak. If one made a new tool with the knowledge gained that 
	protected by replacing the old system itself we would have anther issue.

	Paridox - What is the final goal good locks or good crakers.?

This last is not strictly true.

Dan Bernstein pointed out some time ago that there is a
slection bias when drawing strings from, eg, the decimal expansion of
an irrational.  You can't select them very easily from the far end!

The odds therefore favor selection of a given string
nearer the start of pi's expansion.  This gives
you a very slight amount of information about where the sequence 
is and what follows it. 

Hairsplitting I know...

Presumably, the transmission was the text portion of the statue/puzzle
called 'Kryptos'. It is in the courtyard of the CIA headquarters, and
is the normal monumental work of art for a federal building of that size.
Since it was for the CIA, it was decided to make a puzzle of it, and the
sculptor consulted with someone at NSA to make sure it was hard enough.
The DCIA has a sealed envelope containing the solution. The sculptor has
publically stated that the puzzle is not restricted to the text clues alone,
so I'm not sure that Doug's posting is enough to solve the puzzle. The
cost of the project was about $250K which is normal for a building that size.
Your tax dollar at work.

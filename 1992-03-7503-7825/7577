I do not know of any instances of this other than those in nature using
DNA and RNA.  These are discussed mainly in the biological literature,
and there seem to be problems with accurate transmission.

I do not see that the problem has really changed from the combination of
the two problems of communication and encryption of the communication.
Is there any fundamental difference between a polymer character set and
any other kind?

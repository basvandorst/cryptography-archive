Both of those are known-plaintext attacks: the first an attack on the
system, the second an attack on the key. But neither (1) nor (2) is the
last word in plaintext attacks. In practice a cryptanalyst is faced with
many ciphertexts and some amount of information about each plaintext,
and wants to compute further information. In particular, if the
cryptanalyst knows the plaintexts P_i for some of the ciphertexts C_i,
any method by which he can gain further information may be called a
known-plaintext attack.

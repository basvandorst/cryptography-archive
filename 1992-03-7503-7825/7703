 In fact I think one has to be very careful with using physically
 generated random numbers. Although the underlying process might well be
 random, one is introducing all kinds of measuring instruments in
 between you and the underlying process. Those instruments could well
 introduce biases and correlations. One approach might be to use the
 physically generated random numbers as seeds to a deterministic
 "randomiser" (eg encrypt it with DES say) to get rid of the low order
 biases or correllations of the physical generator.

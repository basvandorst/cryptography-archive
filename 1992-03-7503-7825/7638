Even if somebody handed me the C or Pascal source to a major MS-DOS
program, I still wouldn't feel comfortable making changes to the code.
After all, you need to understand the design philosophy behind it and
exactly why everything was done the way it was.  You'd have to be
*very* careful making any modifications.  I seriously doubt that anyone
disassembling an EXE file is going to ever fully understand the program
they are looking at.  Sure, it is possible.  But good grief...

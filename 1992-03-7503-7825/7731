Yes, *provided* the square contain the numbers 1..n^2, of course!
Obviously Alessandro doesn't require that (I hope!).

If you don't put any restricitions at all on the numbers, the solution
to Alessandro's problem is trivial: Just add replace the central "5"
with a "7" or "15". 


If the numbers are required to be in an arithmetic progression with
first term F and difference D, i.e. F, F+D, F+2D,...  then the sum is

S = (2F + (n^2 - 1) D) n^2 / (2 n)

(since the sum of an arithmetic progression is the sum of the first
term and the last term, all dicided by two).


So what you need to do is, for a fixed n, to find all integers F and D
that satisfy S (F,D) = 17 (or 25). This can be done simply by trying
all possibilities. Good luck!

(I've set Followup-to to sci.math since this hasn't got anything to do
with cryptology).

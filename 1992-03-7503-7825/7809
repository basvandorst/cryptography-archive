Nelson Bolyard (nelson@sgi.COM) points out (via e-mail) that I goofed
in this posting:

In particular, Nelson points out that the CFB description was right
while what I described was similar to (but not quite) OFB (Output
Feedback).

He asked if I have read FIP pub 81.  I haven't.  I've learned these
abbreviations second hand.  Now that he reminds me, I remember this
difference and see that he is right.

Sorry for adding confusion to this topic.

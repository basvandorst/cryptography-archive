It's true that the `population' letter frequencies will vary slightly
depending on the type of text.  However, as a practical matter, i've found
that it doesn't matter much.  The main problem is just sampling error.  As
long as you're talking about English text, and the sample is fairly large, say
a megabyte, then the frequencies will be quite close to `normal'.

For example, the FAQ list gives the order of letters `from several gigabytes
of Usenet traffic' as `ETAOINSRHLDCUMPFGYWBVKXJQZ'.  This is a good list to
use, and there are others which are almost the same.  If you take some other
reasonably large sample of text and order the letters, then i bet you'll find
that the order is similar, with maybe a couple letters transposed with their
neighbors.  I say this because i've done it.

In other words, suppose you have a simple substitution cipher.  A naive way to
break it is to sort the cipher letters by frequency, and replace each one with
the letter in the same position the `canonical' list.  This may seem
hopelessly simple, but in fact it works quite well, if the sample is fairly
large.  Probably only a few letters will be wrong, and those tend to be the
less frequent letters.  This goes to show how weak such a cipher is.  Of
course you can't expect this to work well if you have only a hundred letters.

The only way you can really screw up is to use a word list instead of sampled
text, in other words, using static frequencies instead of dynamic.  This is a
much different thing, and there's no reason to expect it to be similar.

	"Generation of random numbers is too important to be left 
		to chance..."
					Donald Knuth

As so many others will point out (especially if there are any sci.crypt 
readers), the above is misleading.  While the entropy of the compressed
bit stream is greater than the uncompressed stream, there is no reason to
believe that it is "random".  My guess is that any of the standard PRNG
will generate numbers which are more strongly random (pass more statistical
tests) than using the compressed data stream.  XORing two such streams 
may actually DECREASE the randomness of the sequence if there are 
position-dependant factors in the compression scheme.

without bothering to notice that I was describing how to attack the
system described in this message, from lsonko@pearl.tufts.edu, which
is specifically what the poster I was responding to asked about:

   ... It might be bit simpler if you
   simply started at the begining of the book and added the numeric sum of the
   message and book's letter together... IE
   Book, page 1:   "It was a dark and stormy night...
   message         "I have found the map....
         I  t     w a s a dark.....
   Book: 9 20 00 23 01....
   mess  9 00 08 01
         I     h  a v e  found...
   
   code:18 20 08 24 .......
 

Ah, the joys of being abused by finite-state machines.  It's a wonder
that some people can even remember where the 'F' key is.

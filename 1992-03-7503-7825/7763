Regarding NSEA, where  it was observed that a one bit change in the
input produced a one bit change in the output:

I also disagree with the statement above.

A one time pad shares this property, although you'd have to use it
twice to notice... :-)

But seriously, isn't one of the modes of use of DES where you
essentially use it to generate a stream of random numbers which you XOR
with the plaintext? I believe this is used in those applications where
you want byte-at-a-time (or bit-at-a-time) encryption. This system
would have the same property.

The example chosen, namely all zeros except for the last bit, was
perhaps a bit contrived. It is unclear whether NSEA would behave that
way if the other input bits were not all zeros (although if it didn't
one would be forced to conclude that you were learning something about
those other bits -- perhaps you'd be better off this way).

The real question, which remains unanswered (for all of a day so far)
is whether the fact that only one output bit changes in the face of a
chosen plaintext can be used to compromise real communication, for
example by revealing (a part of) the key. This is not at all clear (one
way or the other) for NSEA.

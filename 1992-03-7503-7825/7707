I would like to find out what would be the appropriate, best, or most
usable results of division and modulus operations involving negative
integers for one or both operands.

I am putting together a package to do large number arithmetic (having
not found what I wanted among quite many available free over the net)
and would at least like to make sure that what I design has usability.

Of course the results would still have to fit:
    b != 0 && (a/b)*b + a%b - a == 0
but there are at least 2 different ways to do this with a clear choice
only for both operands positive.

Answers and|or comments by Usenet or Email would be appreciated.
Thanks!

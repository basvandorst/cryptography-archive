The ``r'' in ``rpem'' is for Michael Rabin, not Ron Rivest nor RSA.
While it is claimed that the Diffie-Hellman patent covers it (since it
claims to cover all public key cryptography) -- and some people will
go so far as to claim that the RSA patent covers it (since it does
involve modular exponentiation) -- the cryptosystems are different in
many important ways.  In particular, inverting the Rabin encryption
function is provably equivalent to factoring the modulus, whereas the
strength of RSA is not so well understood.  See the following
references for details.

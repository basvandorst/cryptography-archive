No.  It's just binary data.  As long as the data is decodeable by a
generally available program, I see no problem at all.  Just to be safe
you should make sure you have the decompression program, too, just
in case some fed suits come by to visit.  The basic idea is that you
are not trying to hide your communications on ham radio.

I added: Followups-to: rec.radio.amateur.policy
Legal issues of ham radio should go there.

Issues about choice for packet radio should be on r.r.a.packet and
technical discussions probably still belong in comp.compression and
sci.crypt (not applicable to ham radio).

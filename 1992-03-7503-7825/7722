I remember that a week or two ago there was mention (associated, I
think, with the RSAREF stuff) that the GATT treaty included side
effects regarding patentability of things like RSA. Now, I can't find
the article that mentioned it. I'd very much like to hear some detail
about this issue; our patent lawyer had never heard of such a thing,
and it may effect a number of projects here.

Any help via E-mail please. I'll summarise for the group.

Thanks,
Greg.

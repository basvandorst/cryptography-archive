I have a copy of RSAREF so I can comment on its features (rather than
speculating).

RSAREF does *not* require the keys that you use be registered in any
particular key registry. In fact RSAREF does not even require certificates.
It is designed to make writing a PEM application easy, it does some of
the things that you need to do, but it does not limit what you do. There
is no "built in" root key.

As for requiring people to reveal their private key in order to get
registered (if registration was required, which it isn't), NO ONE IN
THE PEM IMPLEMENTORS AND DESIGNERS COMMUNITY EVER *EVER* ENVISIONED
PEOPLE NEEDING TO DO THIS.

I have written a PEM implementation here at MIT. In my implementation
each user generates her own public/private key pair. The private key
is stored on disk encrypted in a DES key which is derived from a
password that the user is prompted for. Only the public key needs be
revealed to the certifying authority in order to get it registered.

Of course one of the problems with my implementation (if you wish to
call this a problem) is that if someone forgets their password, they
are hosed and can no longer decrypt any messages sent to them
encrypted in the corresponding public key.

Please people, verify your facts before flaming. RSAREF is available
*now* get a copy and examine it rather then speculate how it works
(not to mention being paranoid about it).

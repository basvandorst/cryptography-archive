I won't comment COCOM export control laws, we have been over this
ground many times before...

However RSAREF represents an attempt by RSA Data Security to make
"genuinely ... real live privacy" available to the network community
free of charge and with minimal hassle. I think they should be
applauded rather than flamed at!

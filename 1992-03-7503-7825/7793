Hello All,
          I need some help finding a suitable encryption algorithm.

The one I need has to be:- 

  1) Public Key

  2) Fast at decoding.

  3) Freely available ie either source code must be available or the algorithm
     must be explained in enough detail as to allow a cryptography novice (me!!)     to produce a program with little trouble.

Speed of decoding is more important than the long term security of the message.

If anyone knows of such a cypher could they mail me as much information as
possible (including book references were apropriate).

Thanks


Lyndon Fletcher

I have a DES encryption program that I need to test for compatibilty
with DES(1) running on a SPARCstation.  Because of COCOM, I do not
have DES(1) on my SPARC.

Could some kind soul please encrypt a small file with DES(1), both in 
CBC and ECB mode, and send me the files (UUencoded) and the key you
used to encrypt them.  Please make the key less than 8 characters
long, as I need to check the padding.

Thank you.

Andrew.

P.S.  I'm not really testing the DES encryption here- I've used the
standard tests to do that- I want to test short block handling and
the conversion of keys from ASCII (which DES(1) uses) to binary.

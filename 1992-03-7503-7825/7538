[ I've deleted the bogus "Distribution: sci". ]

I won't quote the original article, since that would appear to be a
violation of copyright.  I'm not a lawyer and I don't even play one on TV,
but I have a couple observations to make.  I don't think PEM is going to
take off if its users have to either pay RSA royalties or abide by the
export-control restrictions on RSAREF.  Speaking of which, point 4 of the
legal summary looks obsolete and incorrect to me.  As I recall, the US
Dept. of Commerce now permits export of cryptographic technology to at
least Canada without a big fuss (i.e. Canada is considered equivalent to
the US for purposes of crypto export).  Given the recent snuggling up to
what used to the USSR, I wouldn't be shocked if this stuff can even to
shipped there with only a little trouble; the Big Red Bogeyman is no
longer under the bed.

And finally a brief flame: bloody software patents and silly goddamned
government regulations are continuing to bugger up any possibility of
progress in the actual use of non-trivial encryption technology.  This
has got to stop if we are ever going to get any serious benefit from
these technologies.  Various governments are going to have to bite the
bullet and admit the possibility that they can't know everything and that
people are genuinely entitled to real, live privacy from blasted
government interference.  Not that I expect that from a government that
thinks that a War On The Constitution (er, Drugs) is a rational concept,
let alone a winnable war.

Snarl, mutter.

I agree. RSADSI supervising key signing is not necessary for most users
needs. RSADSI's service is unacceptably expensive too. It is wrong in
principle to bill a service which should be absolutely public. RDADSI is
making a large businness, that's the real reson. Patents are absurd,
we all know, but there are huge economical interests behind them. I think
that in the future patents on cryptographic algos will be necessary infringed
or ignored, as is quietly happening with PGP.

If someone with a shot-noise (ie quantum noise) generator (ie back-biased zener or
power diode) source would care to generate 10^4--10^6 *REALLY* random numbers
I'll give them a home.  BUT DON'T MAIL THEM HERE!!!  E-mail me and we'll make
some arrangement like put them on a disc and snail-mail
a copy to anyone who wants it, or e-mail a
*short* selection in response to an e-mail request.

Alternatively someone with an ftp site could keep them on-line.

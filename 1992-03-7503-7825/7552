It is important to aim at governments, all (or at least most) governments.
The U.S. is actually quite liberal, there are not restrictions on how you
use cryptography domestically.

If a European (say in Finland) implements a compatible system (the
specifications for PEM are publicly available) then someone in the U.S. and
someone in Finland can community securely.

However in some countries, France for example, it is illegal for encrypted
information to cross the border unless the government is supplied the keys
necessary to decrypt the information!

Crypto export is *not* a U.S. only problem.

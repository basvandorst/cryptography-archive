I have lost the password to a password encrypted WordPerfect document. Has
anyone figured out how to decode an encrypted WordPerfect document?  Any tips, 
or pointers would be greatly appreciated.

I have the following information from WordPerfect Corp.
The first 16 bytes of every WP document is a header.
Bytes 7 and 8 contain the encryption key.
The algorithm is ?Hexadecimal??

Did I interpret the support person correctly?  Again, any help would be greatly
appreciated.

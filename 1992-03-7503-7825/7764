   I have an encrypt program which encrypts an array of characters
with a key of variable length. The crypting routine calculates a 
value from a character in the string and a character in the key.
This value is then used to extract a character from a simple
array of descending characters from 127 to 32 which is stored in
the out-going encrypt string. The next character in the original
string is then crypted with the next character in the key, and so
on..... The pointer to the character used in the key is wrapped
around when the end of the key is reached. In this way, every
character in the original string is replaced with a crypted 
character, and to uncrypt this, one simply executes the same
routine on the crypted string with the correct key.
  
   I have heard that this method is quite a common encryption
method and would like to know if anyone out there has any
idea upon how a crypted message  can be decoded without 
prior knowledge to the key. But one is able to attain a great
amount of coded text for comparison.

   If the description of the encryption method is still blur, 
please let me know, and I will try to clarify any queries.

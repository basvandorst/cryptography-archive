   Is it possible to get somewhere a public domain source for  RSA encryption.
I know about the US export restrictions, but somebody outside the US has probably
implement this and made a never-seen-the-US or at least a never-see-has-seen-the-US
code.

   If none, does a kind soul can supply me with a fast algorythm to assert
primality of large numbers (if not export restricted too ?). I can manage
the rest myself.

   thanks for any hints.

	Can someone gove me the straight dope on Pretty Good Privacy? I've
heard a lot about how it was sorta squished by RSA Security, and all, but I
don't know the whole story. For example, I have heard that PGP 1.0 was the one
that attracted RSA's ire, but I have also heard tell of a version 2.0.

	So, could somebody clue me in? Thanks.

 Fermilab has my permission to disagree, if they really think that's wise.

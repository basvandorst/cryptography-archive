The only other alternative I can think of is to defer the distribution
for the period of time that is reasonable for re-implementing a proper
encryption in the package and getting it out to the public, and letting
the public convert all their files.  Maybe 6 months would be about right.

The problem with this alternative is that 6 months is also plenty of
time for the original person to disappear from the face of the earth
or for some court to come along and make life miserable for him.
Also, if a specific release date is set, it might be easier for certain
people to supress it.  Maybe.

I say go ahead and release it now.

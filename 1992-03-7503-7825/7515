I don't think that the newsgroup needs your condescension. In the last two
weeks the postings here have included information on problems with hash 
functions, patent references for Khufu and Khafe, a new Apple dictionary
product, references to exhaustive attacks on DES, a copy of the Asiacrypt
program, and a comment on the NIST Digital Signature Standard.

So if you have all the information and favourable circumstances to perform
a cryptanalysis, you can perform a cryptanalysis. Is this what you call
`informative' ?

I'm a novice in this area, maybe someone can answer a question for me.  If
PGP is made unavailable in the USA because of patent infringements of the RSA
technology patented by PKP, then what other public key cryptologies are
available in the public domain?

It seems ridiculous to me that in an time when Internet security is becoming 
more and more important, there still isn't a "standard" for ensuring the 
security and authenticity of files on the Internet.

It also seems unacceptable to me that the only thing close to a defacto 
standard is a commercial product. 

I understand that the NSA may be dragging their collective fat asses on 
allowing public key encryption because they can't easily crack it (if they 
can crack it at all).

In the meantime,  are there any alternative public key encryption programs 
in the public domain?  Or are we just SOOL?


Just Curious,
Mark

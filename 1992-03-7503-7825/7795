Close.  The other two were right.  CFB is:

	X(0)=IV
	X(i)=F(X(i-1))

	c(i)=p(i)^(X(i) & 255)

{ where p() and c() are bytes, compared to P() and C() being
blocks (eg., 8 bytes each in DES) }

because in ECB mode, [ C(i)=f(P(i)) ], if P(i)=P(j) for some i and j,
then C(i)=C(j).  That is too much information to give the enemy
cryptanalysts.

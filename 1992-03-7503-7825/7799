First of all, what DO we know about Mersenne primes (I'm not a number theorist;
these are REAL questions):

1. Are there an infinite number of Mersenne primes?

2. What meaning is there to number theorists from the Mersenne composites 
   between Mersenne primes?

3. What is the best use of supercomputer power in Mersenne number theory?  Is
   it in attempts to prove or disprove conjectures, is it in the search for
   examples or counterexamples, etc.  

Second, Cray doesn't need to find big primes to get publicity.  Cray has a 
commanding share of both market dollars and mental position in supercomputing.

It seems to me, anyway, that all we are doing here is exploring the boundaries 
of complexity theory.  The discovery of a new Mersenne prime is relatively
easy in the complexity theory sense.  A theorem prover coming up with an answer
for a significant open conjecture in Mersenne number theory is probably a much
more demanding calculation.  Maybe if we are interested enough, we build a
SPECIAL-PURPOSE supercomputer to search faster than a general-purpose machine
like the Cray 2.  But my basic question still remains: what is the value of
the systematic search?

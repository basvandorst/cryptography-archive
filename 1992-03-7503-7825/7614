I'd have to agree that it'll probably take the release of the cracking-
program to persuade PKWare to improve its crypto-security.

I also agree that there should be enough notice given for them to have
sufficient time to do so.

I *also* agree that too much time would be a Bad Thing.

This has been bouncing around here for what, a month now?

Go ahead, release it.  There's been *plenty* of time for PKWare to either
*do* something or at least *say* they'd do something, and they *haven't*.
I think it shows a lot of irresponsibility on the part of PKWare.
I'm glad *I* don't use their stuff!  (LHA is better, and it's FreeWare!)

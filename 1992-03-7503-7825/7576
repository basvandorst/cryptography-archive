Another good way to make a program hard for someone with a dissasembler
to understand is to write it in an interpreted language.

Most programmers who program in C-like languages tend to find languages
such as Forth, for example, to be kind of confusing at first when they
are purposely trying to learn them.  If they are trying to learn something
like Forth from a dissassembly of a big Forth program, they will have even
more trouble, especially if they don't realize that they are trying to
learn Forth!

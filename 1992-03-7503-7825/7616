I have privately sent Mr. Tufts the information he requested. I have
posted responses to this same query many times in the past. Perhaps it
should be added to the FAQ list???

I will provide code to anyone who can convince me that they are
seriously interested in factoring and who also promises NOT, repeat
NOT to use it under any circumstances for working on the RSA challenge
contest. IMO that contest detracts from more important work.

Let me also say, regarding the challenge contest, that anyone who uses
someone ELSE's computers [e.g. a student using University computers or
an employee using company computers] probably is NOT entitled to receive
money from the contest, because you won the award using someone else's
equipment. In fact, the people who have done the most work on the RSA
challenge contest [A. Lenstra et.al.], are to the best of my knowledge
donating their winnings to charity.  I don't know if Peter Montgomery
is keeping his winnings. He is using UCLA computers [but his own
code. He has the best ecm implementation of anyone. It is superb.].
He may have an agreement with UCLA. I don't know.

A naive question about password security:

Some systems require a password to be changed on a regular
basis.  Presumably, this is to foil a brute force attack on
matching the encrypted password?

Of course, the objection to changing passwords often is that
new passwords are just something new to remember, etc. and
often cause people to write passwords down, thus creating an
entirely different security problem.

The question is this:

If the above assumptions are correct, is it not sufficient to
invoke 'passwd' and, when prompted for the new password, simply
type the old password?  It is my experience that on UNIX systems
this generates a new encrypted password because of the random
selection of the salt.

Or, could this be a very bad policy, if the cracker assumes that this
practice is in place, and has 2 ciphertext strings with different
salts but presumed to correspond to the same plaintext?

Thanks!

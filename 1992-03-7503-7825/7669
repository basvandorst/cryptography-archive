More like, not economically crackable.

Some people enjoy cracking programs just for the challenge (the same sorts of
people who write viruses  :-)

In the PC software world, at the moment, the amount of work spent on
protecting software seems to be related to the market price, the expected
audience, and the type of software.  Most people like to do their own
protection, rather than pay other people (although this is changing I
think).

Most copy-protection schemes I have looked into, are crackable with less
equivalent effort than the market price of the software, which is *much* less
than the cost of developing a program from scratch (obviously).

But this is changing.

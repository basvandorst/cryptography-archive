Who does NOT want this. Unfortunately for as far as I know you are out of luck.
There is RSA but that is loaded with strange patents. It is possible to use
RSA in your software nowadays (there even is a ready made LIB for that purpose)
but commercial use is impossible. Also exporting it out of the USA is not
allowed. 
The speed of RSA is low but this can be solved by combining a private key and
a public key method into a faster public one. The idea is to encrypt the file
with a (random) private key and encrypt the key itsself with the public key.
This way a fast encryption method (e.g. NSEA) can be used for the file.

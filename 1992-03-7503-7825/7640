	See Richard P. Brent, "Parallel Algorithms for Integer Factorization",
Research Report CMA-R49-89, Computer Sciences Laboratory,
The Australian National University, GPO Box 4, Canberra ACT 2601,
Australia, October, 1989.  He argues that there is little potential parallelism
in P-1 and Pollard Rho, but plenty in trial division, ECM, and MPQS.

	My winnings ($590) have gone to the UCLA Mathematics Department.
Nonetheless, UC registration fees increased 40% this academic year
and will do so again next year.

	If you want a copy of my dissertation "An FFT Extension to the
Elliptic Curve Method of Factorization" and didn't request it last month,
please send me your postal address as it will be in late April, 1992.

I've solved USENET problems and want to solve yours.  I'll complete my PhD 
in March, 1992.  Interested in computer performance and number theory.

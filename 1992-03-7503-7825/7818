If the key stream is a genuinely random sequence of characters this
sort of code can be made unbreakable-- if you do the addition right
you get a one-time pad.  If the key sequence is just English text,
even with spaces deleted, what you do is look for sums of common words
in the ciphertext.  If you see 40 16 10, for example, it's very likely
that you just hit THE in both the plaintext and key.  Once you've
gotten even a small wedge it's usually not too hard to read off the
rest of the key and plaintext in parallel.

I, too, have done some RSAREF benchmarks.  Here they are:

I've been doing some benchmarks of the time it takes RSAREF's
RDEMO program to generate 512-bit keypairs on different platforms.
Here's what I've got so far.  Inclusion of a platform in this
list means it passed my admittedly skimpy tests for correctness.

Time to generate 512-bit keypair.  Time is in seconds; user + system time.
Results reported are the fastest times in which correct results were
obtained.  When an operating system is listed under the "Compiler"
column, it means that I used the bundled compiler and could not find
an explicit version number for the compiler.  (These tests are for
the beta version of RSAREF.)

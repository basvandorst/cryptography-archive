A friend has shown me the following "magic square"

			4 | 9 | 2
			---------
			3 | 5 | 7
			---------
			8 | 1 | 6

the sum of each row/colums/diagonal is 15. The question I was posed
was: "does it exists a rule to create a similar square with sum=17 or
sum=25" ?

I'm sure that someone has thought to this in the past: can someone be
of help with the answer?

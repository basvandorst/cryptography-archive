Even given that Pi _does_ contain all subsequences of digits, it
still has an enormous flaw: the only way to get at them is through
the same well-trod road from the beginning, 3.1415926535897...

This means that the fastest supercomputer is can always know more
about Pi than any lesser machine that has computed fewer digits;
does there exist an algorithm for selected a sequence for Pi from
any arbitrary starting point, that is, F(n) gives Pi starting at
the nth decimal point?

If that could exist, then Pi might suddenly become a very good
source of random numbers for the hoi polloi indeed.

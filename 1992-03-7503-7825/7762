I disagree with that general statement. In an on-line stream cipher
preserving data size (examples: one-time pads, Snuffle), the first k
bytes of output will depend only on the first k bytes of input. Is this
a problem? Only if the cipher is misused. In the case of a one-time pad,
you're supposed to continually generate new material. In Snuffle's case,
you're supposed to use distinct time-keys for each new stream, which (if
Merkle's Snefru is cryptographically strong) will simulate a series of
one-time pads. Another example is DES in CFB mode, which if used with
time-keys is not subject to differential cryptanalysis.

I'm not trying to defend NSEA; I haven't studied it in detail. But I
disagree with your criticism of it.

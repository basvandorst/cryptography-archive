I have ZIP files for which I have lost or forgotten the password.  The
files contain some old financial data that would really be of use.  I
manually tried a bunch of keys that I might have used, but with no success.
I've kept the data around all this time just in case I learned of a means
of retrieving it.

I hope you release it.  But maybe you should sell it instead.

Cheers.

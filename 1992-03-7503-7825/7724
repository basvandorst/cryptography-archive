        Someone really ought to market a random number generator board for
PCs.  The market is limited, but definitely exists.  The noise-diode
approach is probably the way to go, that being a quantum phenomenon.
It's not worth doing if you don't already have a distribution channel
for add-on boards, but it could be a nice addition to the product line
of someone who makes minor PC addons.

I've read the license agreement. Talking about the information given in
the documentation isn't "distributing the documentation or any part of
it".  I'd also point out that the license allows you to destroy all
copies of the package to terminate the agreement.

For those interested in how much size it takes:


 40	rsaref/doc		 5 files
121	rsaref/source		23 files
 36	rsaref/test		31 files
  3	rsaref/install/dos	 1 file
  2	rsaref/install/unix	 1 file
  5	rsaref/install/mac	 1 file
  3	rsaref/install/vax	 1 file
 14	rsaref/install
 36	rsaref/rdemo		 1 file
285	rsaref			 2 files

Total of 236204 bytes (these totals include the copy I saved of the
original article, some 18K worth, which is identical to the included
README file except for the date of the announcement and the spelling
of one of the people involved with RSA).

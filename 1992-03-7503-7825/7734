For positive integers a,b,c, the following rules hold.

(a*c)/(b*c)  =  a/b
(a*c)%(b*c)  =  (a%b)*c
(a+b*c)%b    =  a%b
(a+b*c)/b    =  a/b + c

Perhaps it's just a matter of personal preference, but it seems reasonable to
insist that those rules hold for all integers, in which case the operations 
of division and modulus are uniquely defined.

I dunno.  this is getting a bit extreme.   Why don't you just pick a number
between 1 and 10 and let that be the end of it.

or  roll a die   (from an appreciabe height of course)
or  find a nice safe radioactive element and geiger counter
or  tune your FM radio to static and take an energy reading whenever the drop
    from your leaky fawcett hits the bottom of the sink (it's periodic but also
    a chaotic dynamical system)
or  throw a new deck of cards off the empire state building and see which cards 
    hit first & last.  (if you say that it isn't random, I will ask you to
    prove it with EMPIRICAL evidence... IE. start tossing)
or  put a barrel at the top of niagra falls and after each x seconds, note
    where the barrel ends up.  Then do it again until you are arrested or end
    up on the rocks at x seconds.  (yuppers, another chaotic system)
or  gimme a Lorenz attractor.  They're pretty.
or  get 10 million gallons of cleaning solvent, put it in a giant abandoned
    salt mine in Minnesota several miles underground, put loads of detectors
    around it and wait for a proton to decay.  sound goofy? it's going on right
    now.

there must be 50 ways to leave your lover
but give me a nice chaotic system any day.

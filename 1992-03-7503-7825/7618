Someone awhile back was looking for away to decrypt WordPerfect document 
files and I think I have a solution.  There is a software company named:
Accessdata (87 East 600 South, Orem, UT 84058), 1-800-658-5199 that has
a software package that will decrypt any WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, 
Quatro-Pro, MS Excel and Paradox files.  The cost of the package is $185.
Steap prices, but if you think your pw key is less than 10 charactors,
(or 10 char) give them a call and ask for the free demo disk.  The demo
disk will decrypt files that have a 10 char or less pw key.

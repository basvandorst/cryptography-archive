Thanks to Jeff Schiller for responding to my message on RSAREF and PEM.

Jeff says, "Hopefully not much longer," for how long we will have to wait
for a PEM implementation.  I wonder if there is a target date available.
Are we talking May?  December?  1995?

Jeff also points out that RSAREF could be used as the basis for a
public key system when didn't require certificates.  I wonder if it
would be possible to use RSAREF to create a non-PEM certificate-based
system as well.  RSAREF includes message-signing capabilities.  If you
could sign a message, you can sign a message which includes a public key,
thereby certifying it.  It may not be in exactly the format PEM specifies
but an alternative to PEM could accept these other kinds of certificates
(perhaps in addition to PEM certificates).

You'd have to work out the details of the certification process.  PEM has
a very complex and detailed key certification system in which you either
buy (lease?) some kind of self-contained, tamper-resistant, cryptographic
signing box (which records information for RSADSI on how many keys have
been signed by it, so you can be billed), or else you basically get RSADSI
(or someone they designate) to sign keys for you.  (Here I am speaking of
"you" as an organization which wants to certify keys.)

I think some people would be interested in a less, shall we say, centralized
approach to key certification.  It would be interesting to see whether an
acceptable key certification system could be set up without the fatherly hand
of RSADSI supervising key signing.

A WordPerfect password decryption utility is available at
garbo.uwasa.fi: pc/util/wppass2.zip.
The following comes from the documentation:

WPPASS 2.01                  A Wordperfect 5.x File Decryption Utility

      This program will, in many cases, identify WordPerfect 5.x
"protected" file passwords, hopefully making life easier for some
WordPerfect users.

If the reference file is omitted (by
omitting it from the command line and pressing ENTER at the
appropriate prompt), the longest password that can be determined is
10 characters.  With the proper reference file (and the blessings
of the many arcane spirits of personal computing), WPPASS can
identify passwords up to 28 characters long.

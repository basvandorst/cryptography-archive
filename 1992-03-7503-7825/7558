I know this may not be the best place to ask, but I have been unable to
find what I'm looking for.

I need an implementation of the Unix crypt() function for MSDOS.  As far as
I can tell, the BSD code does not function properly under MSDOS.  I am using
Borland's C++ 2.0 compiler.

I've looked with archie but can't seem to find an MSDOS implementation.

I'm primarily a Unix hacker so my efforts with the PC in this area have been
rather frustrating.  I would appreciate any guidance.

Thanks in advance.

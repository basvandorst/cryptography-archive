	Yes once one makes the necessity - if the orginal nesseity wasn't
bad enough make sure it is idea. So do the ends always justify the means ? The 
ends are are NOT the only issue to be solved in any case - you have the 
_immediate_ impact of the "solution" you propose - which may in fact be far 
worse then the current mess itself. Giving the free tool to everyone zeros any 
immediate value whatever locks may have had - which must have been _something_ 
unless one claims everyone already had the tool - if such were true it would
nullify this this debate.

	I am no more placing a value on the contents of your house then of
your computer - re: analogyi, you may be reading far too much into this.  If
someone takes copies of all your records it matters little if it is on
paper or disk as far this overall issue of risks are concerned....

	Nit - You can prove that you know something without giving the details
away - it is an area of some interest in this group.

	This risk is real enough for home owners as it is - now imagine someone
wishing to "solve" this could magically produce and distribute a pic for free
to everyone [ sofeware analogy ]. What would the cost in lost property
be due to the _immediate_ effects _alone_  - that is until which time people 
could have them all changed ? [ Notice I did not include the cost of change 
over given that it is the suggested ends of this very issue ]  Assume further 
that that I have no question regarding the education issue - it must be done.
Given this context I can clearly ask which proposed solution has the greatest 
risk? The means of the solution is being questioned here, NOT the goal...

	It costs money - not everyone has them - not everyone
knows how to make them [ ex: programmer/crypto expert ] not all locks are 
the same - therefore your argument does not stand up.

	No, Security is good but there are many ways of fixing something
that is broken...

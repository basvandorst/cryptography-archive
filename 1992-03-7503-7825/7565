Use self-modifying code.  Then the snooper would have to stop your program
and examine it at the right time.  Examining the executable on disk
would eventually uncover the self-modifying part, but would make for
more work for the snooper.  You could have self-modifying code modify
the code that modifies other code ....  Hmmm, maybe you could encrypt
parts of your code too.  Then decrypt it at run-time and execute the
decrypted version.  There too, the snooper could still figure out what
you did.  I guess it boils down to how much work do want the snooper
to have to do to 'read' your code (and how much work do you want to
do to prevent this).

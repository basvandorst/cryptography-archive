There doesn't seem to be any consensus as to what ought to be done 
with a program such as the one I described in my previous post, though 
the majority seems to support releasing the code.  While it has been 
pointed out that ZIPs are usually on PCs and not network-accessable, I 
am still concerned, since I know many BBSes and individuals rely on ZIP 
encryption to keep files secure on computers that others have access 
to.  Besides, if the computer is physically secure, why encrypt in the 
first place? 
 
I should also point out that I haven't found anything that constitutes 
a real hole in PKZIP's encryption, just that it is possible to brute-
force quickly.  My program isn't anything terribly sophistocated; I
wrote it last summer to test my fast CRC-32 algorithm.  Since I have
never studied cryptology, my computer knowledge is self-taught, and
all my specific info on ZIPs came from the files included with PKZIP,
I don't think this is anything revolutionary, but if a '486 can do a
billion tries/day, there appears to be a cause for concern.  (Is this
correct?)

What I'm currently inclined to do is to release a simple version,
without source code or sophistocated password-generation routines.  I
might make it only test passwords that begin with the letter a, since
that could be hard-wired and would be very difficult to remove.  The
problem still remains about what to do for users with ZIPs that need
decrypting.  Finally, although it's been suggested, I don't think I
should try to make money off the program (though any Stanford student
can tell you how every cent counts...)

Thanks to all who have replied/posted/read these long posts!  I'll
contact the PKZIP BBS in a day or two, and see if the author has any
suggestions.  I'll post any further developments.

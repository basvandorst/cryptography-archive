Does anyone know the data encryption algorithm for DataEase 2.5?  DataEase 2.5
uses some kind of algorithm for encoding its data.  I need to know this
algorithm so that I can write a C program to decode data in a DataEase 2.5 file
and write this data to an altogether different data file.  Better yet, maybe
somebody out there has already written a C program to do this!?

Thanks,

Jonathon Wilk

From my recollections of previous discussion on the net, the STU-III
is a pretty straightforward system, structured roughly like so:

input -> vocoder -> encrypt -> modem -> phone line ...

	... phone line -> modem -> decrypt -> decoder -> output

The slower the modem speed, the less recognizable the identity of the
speaker is (although the words themselves will be understandable).  2400
or 4800 baud gives pretty good quality.

Note: as I said, this is based on recollection of previous discussions
in this newsgroup, not direct experience.  Anyone is free to correct me.

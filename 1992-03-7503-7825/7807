  Yes, but this gives me an IDEA!

  One of the encryption/compression methods I'm fond of is
  building compression models that can encrypt and compress
  your data at the same time.  While all of the models I have
  seen have flaws, I'm pretty sure that there will eventually be 
  "good" models from an encryption standpoint.

  The standard method of "encrypting" using most models is
  to initialize the compression/state space based upon a key 
  of some sort.  Large keys have the standand distribution 
  problems, small keys are much eaiser to break, etc.


  The IDEA! 

  Much like the voice/phone encryption system that depends
  on it's users to tune into a common public radio frequency 
  we could base our key distribution on UseNet articles.

  A typical encrypted/compressed message could have a
  header-line "Encrypted-By: 1992Mar27.044316.197251@cs.cmu.edu"



  Advantages:

  Large keys are distributed automaticly.

  Keys are expired and killed frequently so Key 
  availability decreases with time.

  You could randomly select different large keys for all
  of your messages.
  
  Not everyone will receive all possible keys.



  Disadvantages:

  Obviously anyone who cares to archive all of the newsgroups
  can find your key and decrypt the message.

   -  A possible way around this would be to encrypt
      the shorter E-B: key with a relatively secure
      method.  The amount of data in  E-B: is limited 
      making it much more difficult to break.  


  What do you think?

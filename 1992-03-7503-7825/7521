Phil Karn suggested that alternatives be proposed for DES.  Has anyone seen
any good implementations on the cipher described in:

"On the Construction of Block Ciphers Provably Secure and Not Relying on 
Any Unproved Hypotheses", Yuliang Zheng, Tsutomu Matsumoto, Hideki Imay,
Proceedings of CRYPTO 89, Springer Verlag.

This looked like a very strong cipher.   If modern technology has made this
more feasable, I think it would be a good one.

	Ok, my 2 cents, Let's continue this analogy of software 
protection to door locks

In article <1992Feb28.233327.9979@qualcomm.com>

	Question: where does the sense of security come from ?

	What of choice ? Are you going to pay for the latest hitec
door or one that is "good enough" - I claim the question
of what is "good enough" is the very question here.

	I claim that if look picks were as common by volume as doors 
themselves that people might notice where the tradeoff were in the
software issue as well...

	This would be as good as mass supplying everyone with look picks
in order to "force" people to have better locks. The point of my this
posting is to ask where does such a cycle end and just what is the reason
for such distribution of such lock picks  - ex: maybe to create a new
demand for better protection , etc?

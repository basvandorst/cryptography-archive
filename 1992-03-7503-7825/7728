   I am not sure which of these (if either) is the ``official'' definition:

(1) Given a plaintext-ciphertext pair, any ciphertext written using the
same key can be efficiently decoded.

(2) Given a plaintext-ciphertext pair, the key can be recovered.

   Suppose we are doing a one-time pad using a pseudo-random number generator
with the seed as the key.  This is vulnerable to known plaintext using
definition (1), but not necessarily using definition (2).

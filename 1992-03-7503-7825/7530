How do they expect it to become a standard if they (read: US government)
won't let it out of the US?

It's about time they changed that. It's truly annoying, and at the same time
completely ineffective.

Is anybody going to yell at them? Please tell me if you will call your
congressman and get some action on this meaningless regulation.

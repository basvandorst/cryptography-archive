If memory serves, several weeks ago there appeared an article (or series of
articles) on how to decrypt an ARC file that had been encrypted and the
password had been lost.

I am in such a fix.  If some kind soul could direct me to the solution
to this problem, I'd be forever appreciative.  I have some poetry that I
wrote in 1986, ARC'd, and encrypted with the -g option of PKARC.  I've since
forgotten the password. :(

If you'd like, I can forward the ARC file.  Thanks in advance!

Please email.

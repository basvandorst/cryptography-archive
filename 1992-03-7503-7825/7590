This sounds like a clever idea.

All techniques for shrouding an executable program can be defeated.  For
example the above technique could be defeated simply by copying the code and
modifying the first copy so that it does its CRC calculation on the copy. 
You're then free to insert breakpoints etc wherever you want.

Programs which decrypt on execution are usually simple to circumnavigate.
All you need to do is load the program, run the decrypter, then patch out the
decrypter and save the decrypted program.

It's the same with copy protection.
Your aim would be to make it as difficult and time-consuming as possible for
the potential cracker to crack the program to the point of being able to
disassemble it.  It's *impossible* to completely protect *any* program.
The program has to be able to be run by the computer.
Therefore it is crack-able.

According to the wire stories I've seen, the FBI is not proposing to
expand the scope of their authority.  ``All'' they want is the ability
to continue to do in the future what they're legally entitled to do
today.  The ACLU spokescritters were not, for the most part, upset.
The issue is whether or not technology change should remove this
ability.  The question of whether or not their current authority (which
generally includes the requirement for a court order) is an interesting
one, but it isn't material for sci.crypt, or most other technical
newsgroups.

The technical area for concern was that the FBI, via the FCC, would
be in the position to pass on the acceptability of new technologies
and products.  The potential for mischief, or for retarding technology,
is obvious.

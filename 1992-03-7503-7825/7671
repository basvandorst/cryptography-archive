Your paranoia is showing...

Anyway,you're apparently thinking of ElGamal's algorithms, described in

@article{elgamal,
   author = {Taher {ElGamal}},
   journal = {IEEE Transactions on Information Theory},
   month = {July},
   pages = {469--472},
   title = {A Public Key Cryptosystem and a Signature Scheme Based on Discrete L
ogarithms},
   volume = {IT-31},
   year = {1985}
}

They're based on the difficulty of finding discrete logarithms, not
regular ones.  If used correctly -- i.e., picking really good random
numbers during the encryption -- they're believed to be quite secure.  See

@article{nfscrack,
   author = {Brian A. LaMacchia and Andrew M. Odlyzko},
   journal = {Designs, Codes, and Cryptography},
   pages = {46--62},
   title = {Computation of Discrete Logarithms in Prime Fields},
   volume = {1},
   year = {1991},
}

for guidance on the difficulty of solving discrete logs.

Use of this algorithm may infringe on the Diffie-Hellman patent.  Consult
your own attorney for guidance.

RSA Data Security prefers RSA.  When the government proposed use of
a variation of ElGamal's signature scheme (actually, it's a variation
on Schnorr's scheme, I believe), they explained why they thought RSA
was superior.  Check back issues of comp.risks (on csl.sri.com) for
that discussion.

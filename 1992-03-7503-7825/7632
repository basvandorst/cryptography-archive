Summary: Looking for a dictionary-maker for CBW
Lines: 12


I am using the Crypt Breakers Workbench (CWB) program intensively, and
I wonder where I could grab a program which digests a file or a group
of files and generates a dictionary of the most common words inside these
files. I mean: you run this program upon many C sources and you obtain a
dictionary of most frequently used words in C sources so you can attempt
decoding encrypted C sources.

I am interested in *atomated-aided* cryptoanalisys too.
Any hint will be higly appreciated.

Ciao,	David

What is the proper method?

Whatever the proper method is, consider that at least ONE of the targets
for the distribution is all the people that have a false sense of security
about their "encryption" programs.

IMHO, any program that can be cracked as trivially as ZIP can, should not
be allowed to use the term "crypt" or any derivative.  In fact I do go so
far as simply calling it "not a form of encryption" and so therefore I do
not see any problem in distributing a "cracker" program.

Hopefully if/when it is distributed, it will get to the people who need to
go back and encyrpt better, first.  Is there a way to improve on the
"encryption" in ZIP, yet?  Version 2?

I've understood that the laws in the US only restrict EXPORT, and do not
affect import.  Can anyone verify this?  If so, then as long as not other
laws are broken in the other countries involved, it should be possible
for those of us in the US to obtain implementations from outside (and
possibly spread them around on the inside).


Also maybe someone can collect a list of what cryptotechnology laws there
are in various countries around the world.

beta .92  (7/18/95)  1st public beta release

beta .93  (8/05/95)  minor bug fix.. spaces now allowed in passphrase. Null
passphrases, which caused unpredictable results in beta .92 are now disallowed.

1.0   (9/14/95) unchanged from beta .93, except for some compile/link
options, and some formatting of MPGP.C

beta 1.01 (12/07/95) added support for RSA encrypted files (-p option),
and overwriting of files (-o option) which sends +force as an argument
to pgp.  The -z option now sets the time/date of encrypted files to
zero.  Support for environmental variables PGPPASS and MPGPPASS added.
PGPPASS works as described in the PGP documentation.  MPGPPASS can be
set to your conventional encryption passphrase, in which case you will
not be prompted it. The -d option now decrypts files encrypted either
with a public key or conventionally.  The user is prompted for the
passphrases as needed.

beta 1.02 (1/27/96) User is prompted for passphrases more quickly when many
files are decrypted at once.  Random filename generator improved. 

1.1 (3/14/96) Identical to beta 1.02 except for compilation switches and
the date/version displayed in the banner.

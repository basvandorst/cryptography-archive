testvec.c (compile with sim.c and des.c):  Generates and runs test
vectors.  This program will both run existing input vectors, or 
generate new ones (either randomly or from a script).  When compiled
under DOS, it can either produce Unix (LF only) or DOS (CR/LF)
output files (select with the RAW parameter)

To run the ecb.scr sample script and:
  Store test vectors which go to the chip in TOCHIP.EXT
  Store test vectors received from the chip in FROMCHIP.EXT,
  Produce Unix-style output (LF only)
  Store debugging output in debug.out.

    rm *.EXT
    testvec TOCHIP.EXT FROMCHIP.EXT RAW < ecb.scr > debug.out
                                 
If TOCHIP.EXE already exists when the program is run, it will
read it (instead of expecting a script from stdin).

Use the script random.scr to produce a random test vector, e.g.:
    testvec TOCHIP.EXT FROMCHIP.EXT RAW < random.scr > debug.out

----------------------------------------------------------------------------


ref.c (compile with des.c misc.c):  Runs test scripts (.scr files)
and prints any keys that match.  This is basically a stripped-down
test vector generator for debugging purposes.  (It doesn't make any
attempt to match timings.)

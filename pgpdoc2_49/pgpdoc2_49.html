<H3>Data compression</H3>
<P>PGP normally compresses the plaintext before encrypting it.  It's too
late to compress it after it has been encrypted; encrypted data is
incompressible.  Data compression saves modem transmission time and
disk space and more importantly strengthens cryptographic security.  
Most cryptanalysis techniques exploit redundancies found in the
plaintext to crack the cipher.  Data compression reduces this
redundancy in the plaintext, thereby greatly enhancing resistance to 
cryptanalysis.  It takes extra time to compress the plaintext, but 
from a security point of view it seems worth it, at least in my 
cautious opinion. 
<P>Files that are too short to compress or just don't compress well are
not compressed by PGP.  
<P>If you prefer, you can use PKZIP to compress the plaintext before
encrypting it.  PKZIP is a widely-available and effective MSDOS
shareware compression utility from PKWare, Inc.  Or you can use ZIP,
a PKZIP-compatible freeware compression utility on Unix and other
systems, available from Jean-Loup Gailly.  There is some advantage in
using PKZIP or ZIP in certain cases, because unlike PGP's built-in
compression algorithm, PKZIP and ZIP have the nice feature of
compressing multiple files into a single compressed file, which is
reconstituted again into separate files when decompressed.  PGP will
not try to compress a plaintext file that has already been
compressed.  After decrypting, the recipient can decompress the
plaintext with PKUNZIP.  If the decrypted plaintext is a PKZIP
compressed file, PGP automatically recognizes this and advises the 
recipient that the decrypted plaintext appears to be a PKZIP file.
<P>For the technically curious readers, the current version of PGP uses
the freeware ZIP compression routines written by Jean-loup Gailly,
Mark Adler, and Richard B. Wales.  This ZIP software uses
functionally-equivalent compression algorithms as those used by
PKWare's new PKZIP 2.0.  This ZIP compression software was selected
for PGP mainly because of its free portable C source code
availability, and because it has a really good compression ratio, and
because it's fast.  
<P>Peter Gutmann has also written a nice compression utility called
HPACK, available for free from many Internet FTP sites.  It encrypts
the compressed archives, using PGP data formats and key rings.  He
wanted me to mention that here.

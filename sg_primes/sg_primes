      Sophie Germain was a French mathematician, a contemporary of
Gauss and Lagrange(1776-1831). She was highly regarded by her contem-
poraries and was honored for her accomplishments by having a class of
primes named after her (see Ribenboim,1991). Sophie Germain primes,
(SG primes, for short), figure in the construction of the so-called
"safe" primes, used in the RSA public key cryptosystem. Thus, we have,
      P = 2*p + 1
where P is the "safe" prime and p is the SG prime. For example,
      p = 114 050 99
      P = 228 101 99
Both the "safe" and SG primes have certain properties not shared(?) by other,
"common variety" primes. For example, if p>q, q>5 then,
      p-q = 0(mod 6)
      p*q -1 = 0(mod 6)
A modulus N = P*Q constructed using such primes leads to a simple expression
for the Euler phi-function,
      phi(N) = 4*p*q
It is a simple matter also to show that for such a system the modulus N
is related to p*q as follows,
      p*q = N - k*6
Also,
      p + q = (N-(1 + phi(N))/2
To compute phi(N) let's label the trial values of p*q, (p+q), etc.,
with an apostrophy, e.g., phi'(N), and write the expression for (p*q)'
as follows:
      (p*q)' = N - (N*k1+j)*6
where j=1,2,3...
and
      1/8<k1<1/6
The evaluation of phi(N) is particularly simple for the case when p and
q are of comparable size. We have then
      k1 = 1/8 +1/12*(N)^1/2 + 1/N
and the index j becomes tolerably small, even for very large N.
To arrive at a true value of phi(N) one needs only to test the trial
values of the following quantity
      test = (p + q)'^2 - phi'(N)
to be, first, positive, and when true, to be a perfect square. As a
final step one can test phi(N) for a compliance with the Euler Theorem.
Needless to add, once the correct value of phi(N) has been established
other parameters of RSA can be computed and its modulus factored.
      For a general case of, say, p>q, the multiplier k1 needs to be further
fine-tuned. We will discuss how it is done at some future date. Here is
a modest example to illustrate the computations:
      N = 144 854 310 026 528 578 471 081
On the assumption that p is comparable to q we get
      k1 = 0.12500000000021895408....
However, the value of k1 that would reduce the index j to <1000 is
      k1 = 0.12500000000023551607...
The two Sophie Germain primes in the example are:
      p = 280 096 643 621
      q = 129 289 580 333

<h1>zmail and PGP</h1>

Here comes a little zmail script, which you have to <a
href="pgp.zmail">source</a> in your ~/.zmailrc<br>

<strong>USE AT YOUR OWN RISK !</strong><br>
some parts of this script which are made by me aren't tested enough.
i also don't know zmail enough.

at the moment this works for me under SunOS 5.4
<hr>

Features :
<ul>
  <li> signing your message.
  <li> encrypting your message.
  <li> decrypting your message.<br>
       use this function also if incoming mail is signed.
  <li> getting public keys from your incoming mail.    
      
  <li> passing your Pass Phrase only one time to zmail.<br>
      this is comfortable, but insecure.<br>
      the first time you'll need your Pass Phrase, zmail asks if you want to
      pass it to an intern zmail-varable. if you do so, zmail checks for the
      correctness of this pass phrase. if not, you`ll get another chance next
      time...<br>
      if you choose not to give your Pass Phrase to zmail, you won`t get asked
      another time during the actual zmail-session.<br>
      Think again, this is not secure. It is a little bit better than
      giving the Pass Phrase to an environment variable in your shell, this is
      why i made this function. 

    <li> some useless extra features
  	 <ul> <li>  make URLs clickable. 
		I found this in <a href="news:comp.mail.zmail">comp.mail.zmail</a>
	<li>  uuen/-decoding. Note: <i> my</i> Programm for uudecoding is named <i>uuc</i>
	</ul> 
 </ul>

I found another Script <a href="http://snoopy.cns.iit.edu:8001/z-code/"> at this URL</a>, which has lots of other Scripts, too.

Ron Marlowe gave me kindly the following Information about
this Script. HTH

There is a SERIOUS error in the script, though.  Perhaps this is because 
it is nearly 2 years old.  I'll pass it on to you as it took me quite 
some time to debug.
 
In both send_encrypted and send_signed, there is a command:
 
mail -Q ...
 
This is improper syntax.  It should be (in both scripts):
 
mail -H ...
 
Hope this helps someone else!

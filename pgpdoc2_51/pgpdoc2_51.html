<H2>Compatibility with previous versions of PGP</H2>
<P>PGP version 2.6 can read anything produced by versions 2.3 through
2.7.  However, because of a negotiated agreement between MIT and RSA
Data Security, PGP 2.6 was programmed to change its behavior slightly
on 1 September 1994, triggered by a built-in software timer.  On that
date, version 2.6 started producing a new and slightly different data
format for messages, signatures and keys.  PGP 2.6 will still be able
to read and process messages, signatures, and keys produced under the
old format, but it will generate the new format.  This change is
intended to discourage people from continuing to use the older (2.3a
and earlier) versions of PGP, which Public Key Partners contends
infringes its RSA patent (see the section on <A HREF="legal_issues.html">Legal
  Issues</A>).  ViaCrypt PGP (see the section
<A HREF="pgpdoc2_73.html#0">Where to Get a Commercial Version of
  PGP</A>), versions 2.4 and 2.7, avoids
questions of infringement through Viacrypt's license arrangement with
Public Key Partners.  PGP 2.5 and 2.6 avoid questions of infringement
by using the RSAREF(TM) Cryptographic Toolkit, under license from RSA
Data Security, Inc.
<P>Outside the United States, the RSA patent is not in force, so PGP
users there are free to use implementations of PGP that do not rely on
RSAREF and its restrictions.  See the notes on foreign versions in the
<A HREF="legal_issues.html">Legal Issues section</A> later in this manual.
It seems likely that any versions of PGP prepared outside the US will
accept the new format, whose detailed description is available from
MIT.  If everyone upgrades before September 1994, or soon thereafter,
there will be little interoperability problems.
<P>This format change beginning with 2.6 is similar to the process that
naturally happens when new features are added, causing older versions
of PGP to be unable to read stuff from the newer PGP, while the newer
version can still read the old stuff.  The only difference is that
this is a "legal upgrade", instead of a technical one.  It's a
worthwhile change, if it can achieve peace in our time.
<P>According to ViaCrypt, which sells a commercial version of PGP,
ViaCrypt PGP will evolve to maintain interoperability with new
freeware versions of PGP.
<P>There is a another change that effects interoperability with earlier
versions of PGP.  Unfortunately, due to data format limitations
imposed by RSAREF, PGP 2.5 and 2.6 cannot interpret any messages or
signatures made with PGP version 2.2 or earlier.  Since we had no
choice but to use the new data formats, because of the need to switch
to RSAREF, we can't do anything about this problem.
<P>Beginning with version 2.4 (which was ViaCrypt's first version)
through at least 2.6, PGP does not allow you to generate RSA keys
bigger than 1024 bits.  The upper limit was always intended to be
1024 bits -- there had to be some kind of upper limit, for
performance and interoperability reasons.  But because of a bug in
earlier versions of PGP, it was possible to generate keys larger than
1024 bits.  These larger keys caused interoperability problems
between different older versions of PGP that used different
arithmetic algorithms with different native word sizes.  On some
platforms, PGP choked on the larger keys.  In addition to these older
key size problems, the 1024-bit limit is now enforced by RSAREF.  A
1024-bit key is very likely to be well out of reach of attacks by
major governments.  In a future version, PGP will support bigger keys.
<P>In general, there is compatibility from version 2.0 upwards through
2.4.  Because new features are added, older versions may not always be
able to handle some files created with newer versions.  Because of
massive changes to all the algorithms and data structures, PGP version
2.0 (and later) is not even slightly compatible with PGP version 1.0,
which no one uses anymore anyway.
<P>Future versions of PGP may have to change the data formats for
messages, signatures, keys and key rings, in order to provide
important new features.  We will endeavor to make future versions
handle keys, signatures, and messages from this version, but this is
not guaranteed.  Future releases may provide conversion utilities to
convert old keys, but you may have to dispose of old messages created
with the old PGP.  Also, this current version may not be able to read
stuff produced from all future versions.

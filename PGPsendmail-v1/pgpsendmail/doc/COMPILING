		Notes on how to compile the PGPsendmail/Unix Suite

1)  Where is your  sendmail  programme?

  The SENDMAIL line in the  Makefile  gives you the option of
specifying where the real  sendmail  will reside. Read the  Makefile
for more details. If you get this wrong, unpleasant things will
happen.

2)  Specific platform notes

  NeXT:
  ====
requires the POSIX compatibility library. Use:
% make "CC=cc -posix"

  Solaris 2:
  =========
requires the BSD socket library and the nameserver library. Make sure
/usr/ucb/cc  is your compiler of choice, otherwise, if
/top/SUNWspro/bin/cc  (for example) is your compiler, you need to add
the following to your  make  command:
  "LDFLAGS=-lsocket -lnsl"
Also, you must always supply the following to  make  (unless using GCC):
  "DEFINES=-D__sysvr4__"

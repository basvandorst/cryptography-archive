		CREDITS file for PGPsendmail/Unix

  I'd like to give thanks to the various people who have helped me
make PGPsendmail/Unix what it is today. Firstly, thanks to Peter
Simons (simons@peti.gun.de) who encouraged to me to continue writing
PGPsendmail/Unix after the first weekend of coding, and I had just
discovered this PGPSendmail/AmigaOS thing he wrote. Also thanks to

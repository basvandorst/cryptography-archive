L3 - PRELIMINARY VERSION 0.36 BETA  --  1 June 1993

L3 is a simple public key package using LUCAS encryption based on gmp
1.3. It uses the usual scheme for encryption of files, namely a "random"
session key is generated and padded with more "random" data. The session
key and IV are then encrypted with LUC and used to encrypt this file
itself using a composition of triple DES and IDEA (40 bytes of key
material and 8 bytes of IV, which is more than the random number
generator is "worth" anyway).

Random data is gathered from the system and from the user via keystroke
timings and entry of "random" text. Because of this, the security of the
system is dependent on the user typing in a sufficiently long string of
characters on encrypt and key generation.

Tested on:
sun 4, sun os 4.1.1 (gcc 2.2.2 and 2.3.3)
IBM RS6000, AIX 3.2.0 (gcc 2.3.1)
486/33, Linux 0.99.5/libc 4.3.3 (gcc 2.3.3)

I'm distributing this now, in the hope that people will find flaws in
the system, send comments &c. This really isn't a "production" version
yet. Use at your own risk. I may (and probably will) alter the output
format of L3 in the future and break compatability with this version (in
fact this version is not compatible with 0.34).

If you are looking for a full featured system for email &c., you're
probably better off with RIPEM, PGP, another PEM implementation, or
something else which may not exist as of the time I'm writing this.
However, there is no reason you couldn't use this with some scripts and
something like prencode (included here). A few such sample scripts are
included in the utils directory.

This package is intended to be very simple. No warranty is provided.  In
other words, read the code, understand it, and then you might decide to
trust it. LUC hasn't really been around long enough to have a great
degree of trust in it, anyway.

Incidentally, I did some timing tests which included precompution of
(1/q) mod p, inverses mod (p+-1)(q+-1) &c. to speed up halfluc.  The
performance improvement was negligible (<5%), so I didn't bother.

This implementation of LUC is somewhere between 50% slower and twice as
slow as RSA on the platforms for which I did testing.  The implementation 
could certainly be fine-tuned for better performance.


several commands are included:
-------------------
genkey - generates as LUC key. 
The private key consists of (p,q,e) where p,q are primes satisfying
	certain conditions with respect to e.
	p and q are encrypted
The public key consists of (n,e) where n=pq

the default key size is set to 256 bit primes (512 bit modulus).
I recommend using a 1024 bit or larger key. The maximum in this
version is about 1900 bits. Key generation, decryption and signing 
are very slow with keys this large. 

genkey foo 
will generate a key.
The public component is stored in foo.pub
The private component is stored in foo.prv

p,q in the private component are encrypted using triple DES with
	a password you specify. 

genkey foo 1024
will generate
a key with a 1024 bit modulus. This may take a long time.

You can generate keys with a modulus up to around 1900 bits, but
operations with such keys are very slow.
---
encrypt keyname  <infile >outfile
encrypts infile using keyname.pub
---
decrypt keyname  <infile >outfile
decrypts infile using keyname.prv (you'll be prompted for a password)
---
sign keyname <file >signature
signs file using keyname.prv (MD5 + LUC signatures)
---
vsign keyname signature <file
verifies signature of file using keyname.pub
---
chpwd <private1 >private2
rewrites private1 with a new password. Of course, you need to
know the password of private1. private2 will contain the same
key encrypted with the new password.
---
prv2pub <private >public
derives public key from private key. You need to know the
password of the private key.
---
md5 pubfile

for generating md5 of a public key file. This is  RSADSIs MD5
driver program modified to use LPATH (see below)
---
both genkey and encrypt will grab any surplus parameters and
seed them into the PRNG. 

This means you might want to use:

encrypt joe <infile >outfile  `rndsrc`
genkey joe 1024 `rndsrc`

where rndsrc could be a script which grabs some extra "random"
data from the system (and possibly hashes it, but it needs
to be encoded in a printable way).

---
Note that encrypt/decrypt and sign/vsign don't generate any
temporary files and don't need to know the length of their input
before proceeding. This means that they can be used on
very large files with pipes, for example to make an
encrypted tape.
e.g.
tar cf - . | encrypt pubkey |  suitable dd to tape device
suitable dd from tape device | decrypt pubkey | tar xvf -

----------------------------------------------

In addition I've included Mark Riordan's prencode for encoding
signatures and encrypted messages in printable format and RSA DSI's
MD5 driver with a small modification, essentially for calculating
the md5 value of a public key for verification purposes.

LPATH is the search path for READING private key and public key files.
e.g.
LPATH=$HOME/lkeys:.

Note that genkey does not use LPATH

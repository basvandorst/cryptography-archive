             ******** Enigma for Windows 2.0 *********

* Program description

  Enigma for Windows is a powerful program for ciphering and deciphering
  files of any type. Besides being able to conceal the contents of files
  it can be used as an electronic paper shredder. The Data Encryption
  Standard was implemented in Enigma because of its safety and proven
  workability in everyday use.  The DES is used by many US. Government
  agencies and is a de facto standard. Enigma for Window 2.0 is distributed 
  as a compressed file called ENIGMA20.ZIP. This file was created using 
  PKWARE'S PKZIP 2.04 utility. Enclosed in it are 2 archives called 
  ENIGMA2U.ZIP and ENIGMA2G.ZIP. The first file is the US-English version, 
  the other is the German version. Please unzip the appropriate version 
  onto a diskette and follow the install instructions given in the file
  README.1ST.

Obtainable on BBS:        Yes, f.e. FIDO 2:244/1192

* Differences between shareware and registered version (RV)

  - Encryption according DES only in RV
  - private default user passwort only in RV because needing
    of registration number for saving this passwort

* Differences between release 1.1 and release 2.0

  - A comfortable installation program has been added
  - Context sensitive help by pressing the F1 key
  - Ciphering, deciphering and deleting of several files or whole
    directories in one step
  - Dialog controlled choice of the target directory
  - Stopping the ciphering process
  - 15 % performance gain
  - The option of compressing a file before it is encoded has been
    removed. A program with this functionality is available
    separately.
  - Files created with Version 1.x are incompatible with version
    2.0. This was necessary in order to permit the simultaneous
    handling of several files. The product of this work is a modern
    directory structure on which future versions will be oriented.

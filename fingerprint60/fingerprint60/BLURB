Do you want a powerful, uniform interface to MD5, a standard CRC-32,
Snefru-8, and a combined universal fingerprint, in highly efficient
library form or as easy-to-use programs? That's what this package
provides. The code is freely reusable so you can distribute it along
with your own applications. Have fun.

Subject: C++ implementation of RSA (free)
Date: Tue, 26 Nov 1996 16:47:29 GMT

Just for fun, I just made a simple but elegant C++ implementation of
RSA in C++. The source code is portable, readable and small (c.f.PGP!)

Modular exponentiation is done using the Montgomery method. 

The source is free, and you may do whatever you like with it.
Note that use of RSA may be subject to patent restrictions in some
countries.

Enjoy!

After posting, I noticed that the comparison function could be more
efficiently declared as

  int cf( const vlong & x ) const;

rather than

  int cf( const vlong x ) const;

This should be changed in vlong.hpp and vlong.cpp.

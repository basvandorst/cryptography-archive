These directories contained contributed mailer scripts.  If your
mailer is not included here, or you don't like the scripts provided,
please feel free to submit new ones, but let us know first so that
we don't have duplicate efforts....

Except for the md5sum utility (which generates and checks cryptographic
checksums of files), we do not vouch for any of these utilities.
They looked useful to us, and we hope they are to you, but most are
untested.

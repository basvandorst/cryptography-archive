To integrate PGP 2.1 with Elm and NN:

0) Make sure the path of Perl in the first line of each of the three
files reflects the full path of this utility for your system. Also,
make sure that the EDITOR and PAGER environment variables reflect your
editor and pager of choice (vi and less will be used by default).

1) Put the files morepgp, mailpgp, and postpgp in one of the
directories on your PATH.

2) Modify your ~/.elm/elmrc file to contain the following lines:

	editor	=	mailpgp
	pager	=	morepgp

3) Modify your ~/.nn/init file to contain the following lines:

	set editor	postpgp

That's all folks! Now, each time you post a message or reply to a
message with nn, after you exit your editor, you will be asked whether
you want to sign your message. Each time you compose a private message
with elm, or reply to a message, and leave the editor, you'll be asked
whether you want to sign and/or encrypt the message. When you browse a
message, if it contains any PGP blocks, those will be properly
interpreted. When you reply to a message containing PGP blocks, you'll
have them properly decrypted and quoted in your editor.

BUGS

1) You cannot encrypt messages that you mail from nn. You can only
sign them.

2) When you reply to a PGP-encryted message, the encrypted message is
temporarily kept on the disk, which is a security hole.

3) The temporary files are not wiped out, they are just deleted.

4) The scripts are ugly, reflecting my lack of knowledge of Perl. In
fact, I don't know Perl at all; I hacked somebody else's scripts. If
you know Perl better then me, please feel free to improve the scripts
and don't forget to mail me a copy of the improved version.

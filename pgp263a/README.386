NOTE
====

This archive contains the 32-bit MS-DOS compilation of PGP 2.6.3i. In
order to use it, you must have:

* a 386 processor or better (486, Pentium, etc.)
* a DPMI server (QEMM, 386MAX, Windows, OS/2, etc.)

There is another archive called PGP263I.ZIP which contains the normal,
16-bit compilation of PGP 2.6.3i. This version will run on any MS-DOS
system.

A freeware DPMI server is included in this archive (CWSDPMI). Please
note that this is only a beta version, and thus may not work properly
on all systems. You should only need to use it if you don't already
have a DPMI server installed. To install CWSDPMI, unpack the file
CSDPMIB9.ZIP and follow the directions in CWSDPMI.DOC.

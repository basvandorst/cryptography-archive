  This function looks for the .Ini file and the NewsSrc file.

  The search order is: Command Line               Unique filenames
                       Environment                Standard filenames
                       Application Directory      Standard filenames
                       Windows Directory          Standard filenames
                       Windows System Directory   Standard filenames
                       the path                   Standard filenames


  If the Function is sucessful, the szAppProFile variable contains the path and
  filename of the .Ini file and the szNewsSrc variable contains the path and
  filename of the NewSrc file.

  RETURNS:  zero if sucessful
            -1 if one or both files could not be found

  NOTE: The command line allows for the use of unique names for the standard
        WinVn.ini and NewSrc files. The entry order is .Ini and then NewSrc.

 Command line examples are as follows:

  1. c:\WinVn\My.Ini<sp>c:\Tom\NewsSrc.Tom  => both unique names

  2. c:\Tom<sp>c:\Tom\NewsSrc.Tom        => standard .Ini, unique NewSrc

  3. c:\Tom\TomVn.ini                    => unique .Ini, Standard NewSrc

  4. c:\Tom                              => standard .Ini, Standard NewSrc

  In the first example, if both files exist, szAppProFile = "c:\WinVn\My.Ini",
  szNewsSrc = "c:\Tom\NewsSrc.Tom" and the function returns Zero.

  If the files do not exist but the path's do and if they contain the
  standard file(s), szAppProFile is set to "c:\WinVn\WinVn.Ini",
  szNewsSrc is set to "c:\Tom\NewSrc" and the function returns Zero.

  If the NewSrc file is not found first by it's unique name and then by the
  standard name in the defined directory, the .ini path is searched for the
  standard NewSrc filename and if this file is found, the path and name
  are returned.

  If the command line entry is just a name, the search path is the following:
           the current drive/directory
           windows directory
           windows system directory
           the application directory
           the path

  The above behavior may lead to the use of the wrong information files if the
  standard names are used. It is recommended that unique names be used.

  If the .Ini file or the NewSrc file is/are not found, first by Name
  then by Path with standard names, a warning is displayed and the
  function continues to search for the file(s) in the order described
  above ( Environment, Appication directory, ...etc).

  The intent of this is to allow multiple and unique .Ini and NewsSrc
  location as well and an exhaustive attempt to locate the files.

  Additions to the function/program shold be to popup dialog boxes for the
  necessary information if not found or it is incorrect. Maybe later!

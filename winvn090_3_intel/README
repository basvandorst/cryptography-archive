This is a first effort at building 0.90.3 for NT with a couple of minor mods.
Let me know if you find anything odd.

This new version includes uudecoding of articles and a mime compat. mailer.

The click on the reference is still a bit broken, the article must exist on the
server, or else curtains!

To configure ... 

By default, configuration information is written to the file
WINVN.INI in the current directory.  If the WINVN environment variable is
defined, WinVN will use the value of this variable 

The same rules apply to the NEWSRC. file.  WinVN will look for NEWSRC.
so it must exist, even if only an empty one.

See file INI-INFO.TXT for more detailed information about start-up file 
options.

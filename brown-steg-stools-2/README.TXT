Extracting the S-Tools archive
------------------------------
S-Tools version 2.00 is supplied in the archive file S-TOOLS.ZIP. The file
S-TOOLS.SIG is a PGP signature of this file that you can use to check its
integrity if you so wish. To do this requires my public key which you can
get by either contacting me personally or fingering <asb@cs.nott.ac.uk>

As an added bonus, creating an uncompressed zip and then compressing it as
one file allows PKZIP to take advantage of redundancies in all the archive
files and hence you get a smaller overall distribution zip size.

Everyone wins :-)

Regards,
